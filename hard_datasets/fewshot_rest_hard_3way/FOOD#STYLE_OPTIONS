And they give good quantity for the price.	positive
As usual the omikase didn't disappoint in freshness, although it scored low on creativity and selection.	negative
It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.	negative
It was so much though that I could barely finish but I did, since it was delicious.	neutral
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). 	negative
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.	negative
The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.	neutral
The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.	negative
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.	negative
The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.	positive
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.	negative
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.	negative
The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.	neutral
Very "normal Indian food", but done really well.	neutral
the fish was fresh, though it was cut very thin.	negative
those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.	neutral
â€“ The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).	negative
