-  With that being said, for the price ($800!), you get a nice fast laptop, but if you ask me, it's missing some things that I feel should be automatically included:	positive
A little pricey but it is well, well worth it.	negative
Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.	positive
Battery doesn't hold up to what it said in the description but I got it refurb'd and I imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price (Just a guess).	positive
Even though MacBooks are expensive, you will see that they are well worth the money.	negative
Expensive but worth it.	negative
I appreciate the effort to hit affordable pricing Dell but just not worth it.	positive
I really like the Mac 15.4in. Notebook, but its very pricey.	negative
I wiped nearly everything off of it, installed OpenOffice and Firefox, and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price.	positive
If the price doesn't deter you, you'll find it well worth it in terms of trouble-free operation.	negative
It's more expensive but well worth it in the long run.	negative
Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer.	negative
Only thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality!	negative
Price is great, wish it didn't have Windows 8, but that is an opinion.	positive
The only pro to this computer is it was under $600!	positive
While the price may seem high, it is worth every penny with its many perks.	negative
sounds like a typewriter, but if you can get past that, this is a great laptop for a little money!	positive
