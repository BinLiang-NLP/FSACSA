- The screen is a matte 1080p display, which is nice, but with poor viewing angle.	positive
Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.	negative
So far I do not have any trouble with it other than the picture quality is a bit poor.	negative
So i gave this 4 stars but only because of the poor picture quality, other than that it is a great buy!	negative
The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution.	negative
The display has a great resolution but have difficulty always seeing the small print.	positive
The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions!	negative
