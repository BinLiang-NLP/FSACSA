-  With that being said, for the price ($800!), you get a nice fast laptop, but if you ask me, it's missing some things that I feel should be automatically included:	positive
I wiped nearly everything off of it, installed OpenOffice and Firefox, and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price.	positive
If the price doesn't deter you, you'll find it well worth it in terms of trouble-free operation.	positive
Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality, had poor performance, although it did have great battery life when it did work.	negative
The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution.	positive

i am giviing it four stars instead of five because of no disk drive and the crashing	negative
