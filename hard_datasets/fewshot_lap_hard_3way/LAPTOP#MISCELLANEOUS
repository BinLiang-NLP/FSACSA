Great Laptop for the price, works well with action pack games.	positive
I will give advise any prospective buyers this is not great laptop, Its good for web browsing and word processing	positive
I would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase.	negative
I would've given 5 stars, had it not been for the hours of updates I've had to do to this upon arrival.	negative
It doesn't have a lot of frills, but I didn't need any, and being able to buy what I needed, and not more than I needed was very important.	positive
It is an older model, so know that upfront, but it is everything I was looking for.	neutral
Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.	neutral
Other than the slow CPU it works great for everyday use.	positive
The speakers are fairly basic, so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies.	negative
Yes, it's running and old type processor so, hey, don't even try gaming on it.	negative
