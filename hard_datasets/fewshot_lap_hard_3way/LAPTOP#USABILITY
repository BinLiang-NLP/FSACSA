I love windows 7 but i can't give Toshiba any credit for that, unless y'all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time.	negative
I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home, and it runs just fine.	neutral
I'm also not a fan of Windows 8, but fortunately I can install whatever I want on the laptop without issue.	positive
It is absolutely horrible to use, despite all its so called advanced features.	negative
Like so many others who do this there is a learning curve and I'm excited to do it.	neutral
Not a big deal for me, but if you Skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a Mac.	negative
The Lenovo software that comes preinstalled may qualify as bloatware but is easily removed if you're not interested in it.	positive
The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution.	positive
The build is perfect, the screen fantastic, but I do have a bit of a problem with the fact that I have to buy adaptors for nearly everything, from vga cables to ethernet cables, so, almost perfect...	negative
The pro is a great product, I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge (the edges hurt my wrists).	negative
There is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that.	negative
There is somewhat of a learning curve, but the operating system, and hardware of this Mac are great.	neutral
This laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple doesn't support)!	negative
