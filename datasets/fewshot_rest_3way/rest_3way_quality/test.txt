122	1	0	THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.

280	1	1	Their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK.

282	1	1	Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.

312	1	0	The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.
313	1	0	I LOVE their Thai
314	1	0	noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!
315	1	0	I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.
316	1	1	During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.
317	1	1	The food now is inconsistent.
318	1	0	The food is excellent! 
319	1	0	if you're daring, try the balsamic vinegar over icecream, it's wonderful!
320	1	1	Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.
321	1	1	They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
322	1	0	The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.
323	1	0	Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.
324	1	1	A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
325	1	1	These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:
326	1	0	The food was exceptional.
327	1	0	I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.
328	1	0	The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
329	1	0	The fried dumplings are GREAT!
330	1	0	delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven.
331	1	0	Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
332	1	1	The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.
333	1	0	But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.
334	1	0	You must try the shrimp appetizers.
335	1	0	Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.
336	1	0	Great food, great prices, great service.
337	1	0	If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.
338	1	0	it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.
339	1	1	Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
340	1	0	Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.
341	1	0	The food was absolutely amazing!!
342	1	0	The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we've ever had!! 
343	1	0	The lamb was tender so full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!

345	1	0	The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.
346	1	0	Great food, great decor, great service.
347	1	0	A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer.
348	1	0	The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
349	1	0	The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.
350	1	2	Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.
351	1	1	Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.
352	1	1	The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.
353	1	1	A real dissapointment.
354	1	1	But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.
355	1	1	They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.
356	1	0	Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater.
357	1	0	This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city.
358	1	0	I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).
359	1	0	However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
360	1	0	The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly.

364	1	0	I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
365	1	0	The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.
366	1	1	While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better.
367	1	1	We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.
368	1	0	i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.
369	1	0	stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes.
370	1	1	skip dessert.
371	1	0	Best Reuben sandwich ever!
372	1	0	A classic!
373	1	1	The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.
374	1	1	It just wasn't Thai.
375	1	1	Was surprisingly disappointed.
376	1	1	Pizza was a little soggy.
377	1	0	Ravioli was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.
378	1	2	Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.
379	1	0	Authentic Pakistani food.
380	1	0	Just straight up cheap, good food.
381	1	0	The best pad thai i've ever had.
382	1	1	The food was actually aweful.
383	1	1	I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.
384	1	1	The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.
385	1	0	Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good.
386	1	0	The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.
387	1	0	This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.
388	1	0	I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls.
389	1	0	Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.
390	1	0	Amazing!
391	1	0	The food's as good as ever.
392	1	0	In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.
393	1	0	Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent.
394	1	0	Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!
395	1	0	Beef noodle soup is good as well.
396	1	0	Best Taiwanese food in NY!
397	1	0	The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.
398	1	0	Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor.
399	1	0	I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.
400	1	0	The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.
401	1	0	The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
402	1	0	You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.
403	1	0	Great Indian food and the service is incredible.
404	1	0	Great food and the prices are very reasonable.
405	1	0	The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).
406	1	0	I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.
407	1	0	This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.
408	1	0	Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.
409	1	0	Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...
410	1	0	good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
411	1	0	Consistently good Japanese Tapas.
412	1	0	Yakitori (bbq meats) is tasty too.
413	1	1	If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.
414	1	1	Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
415	1	1	Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.
416	1	0	Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!
417	1	1	I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.
418	1	2	The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.
419	1	0	Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.
420	1	2	I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.
421	1	0	The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!
422	1	0	Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.
423	1	0	The food is great.
424	1	0	The pizza was pretty good and huge.
425	1	1	I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.
426	1	1	The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol
427	1	0	La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.
428	1	0	The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert...definitely going to be back very soon.
429	1	0	I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!
430	1	0	I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here.
431	1	0	We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
432	1	0	Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.
433	1	0	Great food.
434	1	0	The pastas are incredible, the risottos (particularly the sepia) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing.
435	1	1	Overpriced and not tasty 
436	1	1	The food here was mediocre at best. 
437	1	0	Tasty Dog!
438	1	0	An awesome organic dog, and a conscious eco friendly establishment.
439	1	0	One of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten.
440	1	0	But the best pork souvlaki I ever had is the main thing.
441	1	0	Super YUMMY Pizza!
442	1	0	I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza, as well as their pastas!
443	1	0	Excellent food, although the interior could use some help.
444	1	0	I paid just about $60 for a good meal, though :)
445	1	0	Reliable, Fresh Sushi
446	1	0	The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious.
447	1	0	Best. Sushi. Ever.
448	1	0	This place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi.
449	1	0	Creative, consistent, fresh.
450	1	0	Excellent sashimi, and the millennium roll is beyond delicious.
451	1	0	Not cheap but very yummy.
452	1	0	not only is the food
453	1	0	The waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.
454	1	0	Good food: my favorite is the seafood spaghetti.
455	1	0	Excellent food for great prices
456	1	0	The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour, but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food.
457	1	0	i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good
458	1	2	lobster was good, nothing spectacular.
459	1	1	I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked.
460	1	1	Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive.
461	1	0	I wasn't here for the pizza so I can't comment on that yet but what I had was very good.
462	1	0	I ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed.
463	1	0	The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.
464	1	0	The potato balls were not dry at all... in fact it was buttery.
465	1	1	Very immature bartender, didnt know how to make specific drinks, service was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers.
466	1	0	the food is always fresh ...
467	1	1	food was luke warm.
468	1	0	The food was excellent as well as service, however, I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed.
469	1	0	Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down
470	1	0	Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll.
471	1	0	If you don't like it, I don't know what to tell you.
472	1	0	The Seafood Dynamite is also otherworldly.
473	1	0	I'm not even going to bother to describe it; it speaks for itself.
474	1	0	Favorite Sushi in NYC
475	1	0	An unpretentious spot in Park Slope, the sushi is consistently good, the service is pleasant, effective and unassuming.
476	1	0	The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food.
477	1	0	The Dancing, White River and Millenium rolls are musts.
478	1	1	Gross food – Wow-
479	1	1	I can't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York.
480	1	1	My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor.
481	1	1	And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?
482	1	0	Great Indian Food!
483	1	0	The food was good, the place was clean and affordable.
484	1	0	This is one of my favorite spot, very relaxing the food is great all the times , celebrated my engagement and my wedding here , it was very well organized .
485	1	2	Food was OK.
486	1	0	MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious
487	1	0	Watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that's more lemony than smoky.
488	1	0	The omlette for brunch is great...
489	1	0	the spinach is fresh, definately not frozen...
490	1	0	quacamole at pacifico is yummy, as are the wings with chimmichuri.
491	1	1	A weakness is the chicken in the salads.
492	1	1	It's just average, just shredded, no seasoning on it.
493	1	1	Also, I personally wasn't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole.
494	1	2	Overall, decent food at a good price, with friendly people.
495	1	0	Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing!
496	1	0	This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.
497	1	0	What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.
498	1	0	All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.
499	1	0	Great food, amazing service, this place is a class act.
500	1	0	The veal was incredible last night.
501	1	0	Fresh, mind blowing flavors.
502	1	0	Delicious, creative and fun.
503	1	0	Everyone raved about the atmosphere (elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views) and the fabulous food!
504	1	1	The high prices you're going to pay is for the view not for the food.
505	1	1	The stuff tilapia was horrid...tasted like cardboard.
506	1	1	We thought the dessert would be better, Wrong!
507	1	1	The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the "free" appetizer of olives was disappointing.
508	1	0	However, our main course was wonderful.
509	1	0	I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations.
510	1	0	The dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions.
511	1	2	The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy.
512	1	1	Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals.
513	1	1	So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food.
514	1	0	Subtle food and service
515	1	0	Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy.
516	1	0	amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings!!!
517	1	0	amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!!
518	1	0	Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had!
519	1	0	Food took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for.
520	1	1	Maggot in the food!
521	1	2	The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.
522	1	1	Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom.
523	1	1	I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.
524	1	1	Unhygienic
525	1	1	I got hair in my food 2 times of then !
526	1	0	The food is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably priced.
527	1	0	Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance.
528	1	0	Good creative rolls!
529	1	0	They have great rolls, the triple color and norwegetan rolls, are awesome and filling.
530	1	0	One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!
531	1	0	They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert, as well as a great green tea tempura.
532	1	0	The appetizers are also delicious!
533	1	0	Amazing food.
534	1	0	Great food!
535	1	0	I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers.
536	1	0	Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future.
537	1	0	Indo Chinese food, pretty good...
538	1	0	Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food.
539	1	1	My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.
540	1	1	I was speechless by the horrible food.
541	1	1	I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was majorly disappointing.
542	1	1	Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).
543	1	0	for 7 years they have put out the most tasty, most delicious food and kept it that way...
544	1	0	never swaying, never a bad meal, never bad service...
545	1	0	great food, great wine list, great service in a great neighborhood...
546	1	0	so delicious!!!!!!
547	1	0	Hands down the best pizza on the planet.
548	1	0	In about 12 minutes, the thing is gone.
549	1	0	great hot dogs..
550	1	0	the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside.
551	1	0	great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost!
552	1	0	great taste
553	1	0	Great, original taste.
554	1	1	For me dishes a little oily, but overall dining experience good.
555	1	0	great food
556	1	0	This place has great indian chinese food.
557	1	0	The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal.
558	1	0	Even though the place is not beautiful, the food speaks for itself.
559	1	0	Best Indian Chinese in the city, by far!
560	1	0	Everything on the menu is great. 
561	1	0	Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait.
562	1	0	Look, the appetizers were really good.
563	1	0	The entree was also very good.
564	1	1	Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.
565	1	2	Vanison was good but not amazing.
566	1	0	Bison was quite excellent however.
567	1	1	Dessert: pure disaster.
568	1	1	Just not good at all.
569	1	1	Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.
570	1	1	If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.
571	1	1	My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.
572	1	1	I would not expect this for a $55 dinner.
573	1	1	By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!
574	1	1	If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!
575	1	0	The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). 
576	1	1	The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.
577	1	0	I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass...which was very good. 
578	1	0	I heard the lobster roll was excellent. 
579	1	0	All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. 
580	1	0	Great Indian food
581	1	0	Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.
582	1	0	Very "normal Indian food", but done really well.
583	1	0	But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food
584	1	0	The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it.
585	1	0	We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given.
586	1	1	I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.
587	1	1	However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.
588	1	1	My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.
589	1	1	Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.
590	1	1	My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.
591	1	1	Eat at your own risk.
592	1	0	I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.
593	1	1	The nakgi-bokum was horrible.
594	1	1	Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted.
595	1	1	The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
596	1	2	The side dishes were passable, and I did get a refill upon request.
597	1	1	My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish.
598	1	0	The wife had the risotto which was amazing.
599	1	0	It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.
600	1	0	The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.
601	1	0	i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza
602	1	2	A quintessential slice of NYC pizza.
603	1	0	The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.
604	1	0	Personally I like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good.
605	1	0	We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.
606	1	0	I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better.
607	1	0	Great Shabu Shabu
608	1	2	I tried a couple other dishes but wasn't too impressed.
609	1	0	But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.
610	1	0	The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.
611	1	0	Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.
612	1	0	The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.
613	1	0	The food tasted very good.
614	1	0	The family seafood entree was very good.
615	1	0	The main entree was also very good.
616	1	0	Price is high but the food is good, so I would come back again.
617	1	1	This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
618	1	1	The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked.
619	1	0	Good Food
620	1	0	The food was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.
621	1	0	The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.
622	1	0	A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).
623	1	0	Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.
624	1	1	Everything was going good until we got our meals.
625	1	1	It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.
626	1	1	I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.
627	1	1	So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.
628	1	1	So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.
629	1	0	The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.
630	1	0	cirspy crust margherita pizza
631	1	0	it was really good pizza.
632	1	0	the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):)
633	1	0	I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.
634	1	1	The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!
635	1	0	Great Hot Dogs!
636	1	0	Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.
637	1	0	The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!
638	1	0	Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!
639	1	0	But nonetheless--great spot, great food.
640	1	0	Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 
641	1	0	Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 
642	1	0	The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.
643	1	0	Best meal in a long time!
644	1	0	Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.
645	1	0	I had the Lamb special which was perfect.
646	1	0	My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.
647	1	0	The food is great and the environment is even better.
648	1	0	Taking Hot Dogs to the next level
649	1	0	At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.
650	1	0	Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.
651	1	2	The food is very good, but not outstanding.
652	1	1	There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
653	1	1	The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.
654	1	0	The food is good.
655	1	0	Yum!

663	1	0	They are not greasy or anything.
664	1	1	– I was highly disappointed in the food at Pagoda.
665	1	1	The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns, the few they actually give you.....were not good.
666	1	0	Fabulous Italian Food!
667	1	0	The wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy.
668	1	0	– I will never forget the amazing meal, service, and ambiance I experience at this restaurant.

673	1	0	Finally a meal that you will remember for a long time!
674	1	0	– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants, its nice to see a place that bucks that trend, and just plain delivers high quality food and good service, period.
675	1	0	This is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer.
676	1	0	Caution - its real food for people who love the best.
677	1	1	I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price.
678	1	1	I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it.
679	1	1	Rice is too dry, tuna wasn't so fresh either.
680	1	1	Nothing really came across as outstanding.
681	1	0	I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent.

684	1	0	The sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted.
685	1	0	Their apps are all delicious.
686	1	1	– The food was not great & the waiters were rude.
687	1	0	food was fine, with a some little-tastier-than-normal salsa.
688	1	0	the food was great, the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.
689	1	1	the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it's edible, even when you order ahead.
690	1	0	BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.
691	1	0	Best Sushi in town.
692	1	0	Everything you want and more, very fresh.

696	1	0	The sushi here is delicious!
697	1	0	I've had the Jellyfish, Horse Mackerel, Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good.
698	1	2	Mediocre food
699	1	1	My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price.
700	1	1	We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.
701	1	0	Excellent food, nice ambience, fairly expensive
702	1	0	– I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi (5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes.
703	1	0	Best Indian food in L.A.
704	1	0	The chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes.
705	1	0	The chana masala (garbanzo beans) are also excellent.
706	1	0	It's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center, not the greatest location, but the food keeps me coming back for more.
707	1	0	I think I have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent.
708	1	0	I can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma.
709	1	0	– I really enjoyed my meal here.
710	1	0	I had yummy lamb korma, saag paneer, samosas, naan, etc.
711	1	1	I should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild.
712	1	0	The naan was some of the best I've had and I really enjoyed the bhartha, not too tomatoey.
713	1	0	Even the chickpeas, which I normally find too dry, were good.
714	1	0	– I don't understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long... the fajita salad, the colorado, the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious.
715	1	0	i am never disappointed with there food.
716	1	0	Everything I've had here is good, taco salads, burritos, enchiladas i love this place.

721	1	0	What a tastly, flaky treat!
722	1	0	Holy Hummus!
723	1	0	Dinners have always been excellent, in terms of food quality.
724	1	0	The side of potatoes is to die for, as is the labne (yogurt dip).
725	1	0	Also, they serve THE best hummus in America, with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil (which, I believe is the traditional way)!
726	1	1	I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal.
727	1	0	We ordered a selection of the small plates, and the shoe string onions, goat cheese pizza, grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good.
728	1	1	The food is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).
729	1	0	Open & Cool Place with the Best Pizza and Coffee
730	1	0	– Mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu.

739	1	0	– Eggs, pancakes, potatoes, fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious.

752	1	0	Save room for  scrumptious desserts.
753	1	0	Love the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their specials.
754	1	0	The cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes.
755	1	0	The sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick.
756	1	0	Space was limited, but the food made up for it.
757	1	1	The Caesar salad I ordered had so much lemon I couldn't eat it.

763	1	0	The place is the next best thing to my Moms cooking.
764	1	0	Best food, phenominal service 
765	1	0	For the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best NYC has to offer, the fish is the freshest and the service is superb.
766	1	2	If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food, then I would put Murphy's at the top of the list.
767	1	2	The regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive.
768	1	0	Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.

770	1	0	Hands down, the best tuna I have ever had.
771	1	0	Great value sushi with high quality & nice setting.
772	1	0	Try the Chef's Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty.
773	1	1	Poor customer service/poor pizza.
774	1	1	I know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places, but Mioposto's pizza lacks quality and good taste.
775	1	1	To be honest, I've had better frozen pizza.
776	1	0	The food is fantastic, and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we've been there.
777	1	0	Seafood Plus
778	1	0	The appetizer of oysters, lobster, crab (small size) made a perfect entre for my wife.
779	1	0	Seabass on lobster risotto was the best.
780	1	0	Caesar salad was superb.
781	1	0	Leave room for dessert.
782	1	2	The food was ok, but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.
783	1	0	Best Crab Cakes in Town
784	1	0	– Thats a big statement considering I've been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since I was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time.
785	1	0	Great seasonal fish and seafood, with a classy waterfront setting.
786	1	0	Great Pizza, Poor Service
787	1	0	– Love their pizza, especially the mushroom pizza.
788	1	0	Also love their caeser salad.
789	1	0	Many people talk about the great pizza and poor service, so it can't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers.

791	1	0	– This place is famous for their breakfast.
792	1	0	The food is great and they make a mean bloody mary.
793	1	0	I love breakfast here.
794	1	0	Their crab eggs benedict is addicting.
795	1	0	All their menu items are a hit, and they serve mimosas.
796	1	0	best chinese food i have tasted in a long time
797	1	0	so about the prawns, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter... soooo good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.
798	1	0	yummy.
799	1	0	best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted.
800	1	0	the brocollis were so fresh and tasty.
801	1	0	i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time, every piece was as eventful as the first one... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked.
802	1	0	not chewy at all.
803	1	0	for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee... oh la la yummy!!!
804	1	0	melt in your mouth.
805	1	0	– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).
806	1	2	Terrible service, food ok, pricey
807	1	2	Food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.
808	1	0	Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi (that eel with avodcao -- um um um).
809	1	0	As usual the omikase didn't disappoint in freshness, although it scored low on creativity and selection.
810	1	0	Their specialty rolls are impressive, though I can't remember what we had.
811	1	0	Green tea creme brulee gets better each time I have it.
812	1	0	It isn't the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time.
813	1	2	– Schooner or Later's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor customer service.
814	1	0	While this diner had reasonably good food, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.
815	1	0	you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi...then this might be the place.
816	1	0	the fish was fresh, though it was cut very thin.

826	1	0	I picked the asparagus, which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.
827	1	0	The 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great, at least initially.
828	1	0	The steak was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.
829	1	2	It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.
830	1	1	Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak.
831	1	1	My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ?MSG? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant.
832	1	0	They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.
833	1	0	The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.
834	1	0	good sake, good food – i honestly don't know much about japanese food at all.

841	1	0	Try the Pizza Ensalata!
842	1	0	Absolutely delicious.
843	1	0	The food is sinful.
844	1	0	The specialty here is decadent pancakes, but I've been back now four times, and I've been wowed every time.
845	1	0	Nothing on the menu is less than amazing.
846	1	0	Go with some friends, wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe, and enjoy more than your average breakfast.
847	1	0	Good eats.
848	1	1	Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that's half-way decent.
849	1	1	I have been here, spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment.
850	1	1	Fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $100 dollar plate and NOT ONE was eatable.
851	1	0	Delicious
852	1	0	The best dish are the honwy walnut prawns- just outstanding.
853	1	0	The service was excellent, the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding.
854	1	0	Delicious...!
855	1	0	The food is fantastic, authentic, delicious and very, very affordable.
856	1	0	Delectable 
857	1	0	Everything, and I mean everything on the menu is delectable.
858	1	0	The sushi is as fresh as it comes?you'd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!
859	1	0	If you're interested in good tasting (without the fish taste or smell), large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place...
860	1	0	The pizza itself is not exactly the best I've had EVER, but still pretty good.
861	1	0	Food was good and appetizing.
862	1	0	The appetizer was interesting, but the Creme Brulee was very savory and delicious.
863	1	0	Late night dinning with exeptional food.
864	1	0	The food was very good, filet mignon was probably the best I've ever try.
865	1	0	– Mercedes restaurant is so tasty, the service is undeniably awesome!
866	1	0	The chips  and salsa are so yummy, and the prices are fabulous.
867	1	0	The catering is out of this world, and Raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world!!!
868	1	1	On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.
869	1	1	I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.
870	1	0	My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.
871	1	0	For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.
872	1	0	The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).
873	1	0	My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.
874	1	0	I had a taste of all three items on her plate, and they were superb.
875	1	0	While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one.
876	1	1	It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
877	1	1	Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.
878	1	0	I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.
879	1	2	Everything we had was good or ok....but definitely nothing great.
