4	0	0	Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.
5	0	0	This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.
6	0	0	However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!
7	0	0	Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.

42	0	0	THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.
43	0	0	It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.
44	0	1	First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.
45	0	1	Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.
46	0	1	The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.
47	0	0	Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.
48	0	0	The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.
49	0	0	A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.
50	0	0	The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!

54	0	2	The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.
55	0	0	This place is so much fun.
56	0	0	It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
57	0	0	The place is a lot of fun.

62	0	0	I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.
63	0	0	The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.
64	0	0	The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
65	0	2	The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.
66	0	2	A little noise but I think that was because of our party!

92	0	0	Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.
93	0	0	delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere.
94	0	0	Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax.
95	0	1	Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.
96	0	0	The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant.
97	0	0	This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside.
98	0	1	Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.
99	0	1	If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.
100	0	0	Great atmoshere and worth every bit.
101	0	0	The place was quiet and delightful.
102	0	0	But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
103	0	0	You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music.
104	0	0	The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.

106	0	0	The setting is casual and romantic.
107	0	1	The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
108	0	2	The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.
109	0	0	this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.
110	0	1	The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.
111	0	0	This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
112	0	0	also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the service it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!
113	0	0	The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.
114	0	0	The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.
115	0	0	Cute and decorative.
116	0	0	Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.
117	0	0	Great food, great decor, great service.

143	0	0	Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too...
144	0	0	Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!
145	0	0	Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.

152	0	0	I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!
153	0	0	I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant.

168	0	0	It is so romantic.
169	0	0	Its dark, and cozy.. there is always jazz music playing when we go.
170	0	0	Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple.
171	0	0	Everyone raved about the atmosphere (elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views) and the fabulous food!
172	0	1	Service ok but unfriendly,filthy bathroom.
173	0	1	oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting.
174	0	1	The floor was wet, the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor, no soap, and no hand towels left.
175	0	0	All in all, I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future.
176	0	0	short and sweet – seating is great:it's romantic,cozy and private.
177	0	0	The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.

179	0	2	So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food.
180	0	0	Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had!
181	0	0	We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd.
182	0	0	The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.
183	0	1	Mazing interior.
184	0	1	The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.
185	0	1	If you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing.
186	0	1	Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future.
187	0	2	Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food.
188	0	1	The only thing that strikes you is the decor?(not very pleasant).
189	0	1	Even though the place is not beautiful, the food speaks for itself.
190	0	0	The DJ is awesome, I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back.
191	0	0	Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait.
192	0	2	What you are paying for is the environment and the name.
193	0	0	Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.
194	0	2	The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.
195	0	0	The place is beautiful!
196	0	1	I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.
197	0	0	Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
198	0	0	I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.
199	0	0	Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
200	0	0	This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!
201	0	0	Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city.
202	0	0	If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).
203	0	0	It’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!
204	0	0	I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.
205	0	1	This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...
206	0	1	This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
207	0	1	The food was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.
208	0	0	Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
209	0	0	The atmosphere was great.
210	0	0	Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.
211	0	0	The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)
212	0	0	I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.
213	0	0	It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.
214	0	2	The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!
215	0	0	The food is great and the environment is even better.
216	0	0	Great Atmosphere
217	0	0	The design of the space is good.

220	0	0	This is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer.
221	0	0	I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price.
222	0	0	But the space is small and lovely, and the service is helpful.
223	0	0	– ...and the best summertime deck experience--they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather.
224	0	0	Endless fun, awesome music, great staff!!!
225	0	0	Definitely has one of the best jukebox's i've seen in a long long time.
226	0	0	And the upstairs is a great place to hang out.
227	0	2	The decor is rustic, traditional Japanese.
228	0	0	Excellent food, nice ambience, fairly expensive
229	0	0	The ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney.
230	0	0	It was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of Italy, and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa.
231	0	0	I love the warm & cosy environment.
232	0	0	best restaurant in the world, great decor, great customer service, friendly manager
233	0	0	the atmosphere is great.

250	0	0	When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible!
251	0	0	Great seasonal fish and seafood, with a classy waterfront setting.
252	0	0	You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing.
253	0	0	the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning.
254	0	0	not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up.
255	0	2	Food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.
256	0	0	Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.
257	0	0	The music is great, no night better or worse, the bar tenders are generous with the pouring, and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits.
258	0	0	Seriously, you can't go wrong, if it is unpretentious local fun you seek.
259	0	0	When I walked in, I was taken aback by their incredible wood decor.
260	0	1	The waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded.

268	0	0	We were seated right away, the table was private and nice.
269	0	0	Groovy music made the dinner casual.
270	0	0	The atmosphere is aspiring, and  the decor is festive and amazing..
271	0	0	Drinks are suberb, and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door.
272	0	0	The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.
273	0	1	Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. 
274	0	1	This place is incredibly tiny.
275	0	0	Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.
276	0	2	This place is always packed.
277	0	2	Of course, it is crowded but who cares.
278	0	2	The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour, but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food.
279	0	0	Inexpensive, unassuming, great time!
280	0	1	Be prepared to wait, because the place is pretty tiny.
