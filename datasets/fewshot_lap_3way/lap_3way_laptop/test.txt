330	1	1	I have had the luxury (sarcasm) of owning 2 of these laptops.
331	1	1	I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.
332	1	1	returned it.
333	1	0	They are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat.
334	1	0	Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.
335	1	1	This laptop leaves alot to be desired, I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice...
336	1	1	If you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal.
337	1	1	I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from!
338	1	0	The perfect notebook...
339	1	1	I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE.
340	1	0	I do everything on this computer - check email, facebook, shop, check blogs, write papers, listen to music, and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv.
341	1	0	So, if you're thinking of a laptop, I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook for all your needs!
342	1	0	It's great and we will always stick with Apple computers, we have been so happy with them.
343	1	1	Probbly the worst decision we ever made!
344	1	0	pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.
345	1	1	So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
346	1	1	I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would.
347	1	1	I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use.
348	1	1	It's a bummer and one out of five is being kind.
349	1	1	My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary.
350	1	1	In due course, I'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.
351	1	0	I highly recommend that you buy this product.

357	1	0	it's just a great toy to have around.
358	1	0	Amazing machine.
359	1	0	Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop!
360	1	0	Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac!
361	1	1	I never have had a good result with this computer.
362	1	1	I don't like this company nor the toshiba brand, and I'll never  buy another one because I've put more into it then it is worth.
363	1	1	I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund.
364	1	1	i cant believe HP put this out.
365	1	1	do not buy you will be disappointed.
366	1	1	i'm returning mine
367	1	2	dell is a decently made pc.
368	1	1	so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.
369	1	0	I love HP,, it's the only computer/printer we will buy.
370	1	0	At first when I got this product, I loved it.

391	1	0	I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it!
392	1	0	I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar.
393	1	0	With all the goodies inside this machine, it is a value.
394	1	1	The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable.
395	1	1	I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card, but still requires a return.

404	1	1	I was so happy with my new Mac.

762	1	0	Otherwise I am happily a  Mac user.
763	1	2	For a premium laptop sold in 2013, the Apple MacBook Pro (13 inch, base model) is about as basic as it gets: no SSD, no discrete graphics, no 1080p display, and no touch screen.
764	1	1	This, added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money, detracts from the computer's value.
765	1	0	Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer.

768	1	1	I was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase.

774	1	1	I can't believe people like these computers.
775	1	1	Don't waste your money.
776	1	1	My HP seemed great at first, then the problems started.....wireless adapter would just &quot;disappear&quot; and the system said it didn't have a network card.
777	1	1	I don't have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support, search functions, or hold times.....dropped the HP and never looked back.
778	1	0	I gave this product 5 stars because I have been looking for a MacBook Pro for a long time and I found it here for a wonderful price.

782	1	0	I'll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself, and just conclude by saying that I'm delighted with my purchase.
783	1	0	Received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed.
784	1	0	It's a great laptop, but right now it's annoying to use the touchpad.
785	1	1	Being only 2 months old, I am not a happy camper!
786	1	0	Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.
787	1	1	I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage.
