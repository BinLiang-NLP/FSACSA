120	0	0	it has 3 usb ports, 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion.
121	0	2	the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.
122	0	0	what an elegant, wonderful machine.
123	0	2	i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus.
124	0	1	I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.
125	0	2	I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.

143	0	0	Of course, I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie.
144	0	1	the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.
145	0	1	with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.

173	0	0	i'm very happy,this laptop is beatifull, is'nt slow at all.

221	0	0	Glad it has the DVD drive.
222	0	2	Its fast, powerful, screen display is top notch and the battery life is excellent for a laptop of this size.
223	0	1	My only concern is that since the battery is not external, I will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time.
224	0	1	And the only microphone input is for a combo Mike/Speaker plug.

231	0	1	6.Still feels too heavy to me.
232	0	1	Could lose another pound or two.
233	0	0	So with this new order, all the upgrades and windows 8 really caught my eye and I got this for the long haul.
234	0	1	It seems like Lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on.
235	0	1	The cords always feel like they are in my way.
236	0	1	It's clunky, heavy, and a pain to start up and shut down.
237	0	0	Uhhhhhh, the computer looks good.

241	0	0	The screen is good, the whole things is very light and doesn't run hot.

243	0	1	Ok, one light to let you know if the damn thing is on.
244	0	0	Retina screen, solid build quality, weight, fast processor and the reliability of the Apple brand.

262	0	0	love the flip feature and the touch screen feature.

283	0	0	It's also incredibly light, has a battery that can last for days, and looks like a piece of art.
284	0	0	Though, that's pretty much what your paying for -- a well designed device.
285	0	1	When you look at the internal specs, the computer is only worth about $500.
286	0	0	It mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don't need.

290	0	0	This ASUS you're looking at right here, and that I'm typing on right now, has one.
291	0	1	-  With that being said, for the price ($800!), you get a nice fast laptop, but if you ask me, it's missing some things that I feel should be automatically included:
292	0	1	This laptop has no:  - Touchscreen  - Optical Drives (OK, a bit of a stretch, because that would eat up precious space in this monster)  - Swivel or detachable screen
293	0	1	What this laptop does have is:  - Windows 8, which is confusing as all get-out  - Tons of &amp;#34;bloatware&amp;#34;.
294	0	0	Love the 360 degree rotation and the touch screen works great, but a little bit of a learning curve there too, as sometimes I have to tap a few times to get the exact location I need...
295	0	0	I've only had this for a week Overall I like the computer, it's thin &amp; light and The wireless keyboard works great.
296	0	0	I was impressed; Sony puts in small touches like a USB charging port on the charger.
297	0	1	One thing I did't like is the stylus holder, it's cheap plastic and doesn't seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the USB port.
298	0	0	It's light, fast and has great battery!!
299	0	0	It's a steal when considering the specs and performance as well.
300	0	2	US 3.0 comes with the MBP and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps.
301	0	2	Other ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack.
302	0	2	SDHC card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs.
303	0	0	The unique to apple aluminium uni-body is a real beauty.
304	0	0	By the way, it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what I had just listed.
305	0	0	If you are looking for a light, durable, and extremely effecient laptop, buy this one!
306	0	0	Like it was designed for what people would want to the system to do, very user-friendly.
307	0	0	Its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great, aside from its quality design and sexy looks.
308	0	0	Also, the laptop is quite, no more burnt laps, best screen display, and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over.
309	0	0	The new operating system called Snow Leopard is installed and ready for use
310	0	0	Reliability: Throughout the past few years, I have had no problems with the MacBook Pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws.
311	0	0	The processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly.
312	0	0	My first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also, brilliant.
313	0	0	Plenty of ports and since this is my first laptop, I really don't have anything to compare it to.
314	0	1	Note: no DVD drive, no Ethernet port
315	0	1	Power on - good luck finding it.
316	0	2	The laptop is a little more than an inch thick when closed.
317	0	2	But what should I expect from a unit that is this thin and this light?
318	0	0	One OS for this platform, no OEM OS paraphernalia and automatic updates.
319	0	2	For a premium laptop sold in 2013, the Apple MacBook Pro (13 inch, base model) is about as basic as it gets: no SSD, no discrete graphics, no 1080p display, and no touch screen.
320	0	0	What it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side, Apple's OSX Mountain Lion, the sleek looks Apple always delivers, reasonable specs, good battery life, nice keyboard, and excellent trackpad.
321	0	1	The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution.
322	0	1	I don't understand why only Windows 7 Starter is included.
323	0	1	I was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain Flash.
324	0	2	Now the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic (medium low grade) plastic.
