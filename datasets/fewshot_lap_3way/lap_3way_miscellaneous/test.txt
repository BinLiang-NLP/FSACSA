46	2	0	Right out of the box, this little netbook did everything I asked of it, including streaming the everyday video you're bound to encounter checking mail and websites (my biggest complaint previously).

64	2	1	The book is useless.
65	2	1	The machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your HDTV.
66	2	0	Great laptop for school, easy to use for beginners in the household.
67	2	0	You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever.
68	2	2	overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive.
69	2	1	This computer doesn't do that well with certain games it can't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.

110	2	1	If you want a computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video, this computer is NOT for you.
111	2	1	Now when I say don't expect to play games on it, I mean it.
112	2	1	Pretty much every major game save for Solitare won't even play on it due to the slower processor.
113	2	0	I needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine.
114	2	0	It's exactly like the picture and I AM SATISFIED.

118	2	2	Its a very basic laptop.
119	2	0	Other than the slow CPU it works great for everyday use.
120	2	1	Heavy gaming is definitely not it's strong point.
121	2	0	The machine is easy to use, has the power it needs for personal use and some light professional work.
122	2	0	The i7 is incredibly fast, the RAM makes it proper for several games (not on maximum quality).
123	2	1	NEEDS MORE INSTRUCTIONS WITH IT
124	2	1	I only use a laptop for personal use, but this one can't even handle that!
125	2	1	My final thoughts: if you are a Mac user, stay away.
126	2	0	Great for games
127	2	0	However, this laptop far exceeded my expectations when I bought it for college, I only use Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essentials, run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years.
128	2	1	If you want to game, this thing can handle League of Legends on medium-low settings, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for gaming.
129	2	0	Overall, a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web-browsing.
130	2	0	Would definitely recommend for those who are "technologically ignorant"
131	2	0	If you're looking for a basic PC this is the way to go.
132	2	0	So far I haven't lost any quality or information.
133	2	1	Though I don't have much installed, I only have 96 of the 278G left!
134	2	1	I have no idea what's taking up all the room, it doesn't make sense.
135	2	0	Very fast and good for most steam games.
136	2	1	Yes, it's running and old type processor so, hey, don't even try gaming on it.
137	2	0	But, if you are just an average user, it works really great.
138	2	1	And the settings are simply annoying.
139	2	1	It came with no instruction book - no back up CD's and has already crashed.
140	2	0	It's great for what he uses it for.
141	2	2	Of course this will decrease your battery life.
142	2	1	plus - no russian input ??  wtf
143	2	0	What a great laptop, I can run my games and work really fast.
144	2	0	Also, the resale value on this will keep.
145	2	0	I play Sims 4 and 3 on it all the time, with very little issues.
146	2	0	I bought this pc to play games and stream movies! it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd!
147	2	0	This laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing.
148	2	1	The speakers are fairly basic, so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies.
149	2	0	If you draw on the other hand i'm sure you will love using this in tablet mode.
150	2	0	- It can run games really well.
151	2	2	Well, not really well.
152	2	0	The Mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized, lazy, and eye candy person in all of us.
153	2	1	I would've given 5 stars, had it not been for the hours of updates I've had to do to this upon arrival.
154	2	1	Negatives:  - As aforementioned, my only con was the updates.
155	2	0	If you are looking to get a 2-in-1 laptop, this is the laptop you should consider.
156	2	0	It also is nice to be able to play Candy Crush or Angry Birds when in between classes straight from your laptop.
157	2	0	It makes it much more exciting to play!
158	2	2	It is an older model, so know that upfront, but it is everything I was looking for.
159	2	2	I know people were complaining that it isn't the newest model, but it all depends on what you are looking for.
160	2	0	This computer is a fantastic tool for word processing, searching the internet, and keeping track of everyday life.
161	2	1	It has a 128 GB storage capacity (but with the option of a 256 GB hard drive) and a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, so don't expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too.
162	2	1	I would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase.
163	2	1	The other Issue I had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it.
164	2	0	Awesome laptop for college!!!
165	2	0	Can be used for gaming as well.
166	2	0	I can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed.
167	2	0	I usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing, so the entry-level 13' MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for.
168	2	0	This laptop was made for art, music, beat-making, pictures, movies, graphic design.
169	2	0	The MacBook Pro is useful for college students for many reasons:
170	2	1	Maybe I'm not being reasonable, but I don't feel that's the same as a new computer because I didn't pay for a refurbished computer.
171	2	1	Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag, and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs.
172	2	1	I'm a designer turned front-end developer and this computer is unusable for front-end development.
173	2	1	When I had a boot up issue, the HP recovery didn't work.
174	2	1	The disks I made wouldn't work.....HP support stated &quot;we're a hardware company, not a software company.&quot;
175	2	1	I have not tried gaming on it but I have heard that Mac/Apple does not do games well.
176	2	0	For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop.
177	2	0	It doesn't have a lot of frills, but I didn't need any, and being able to buy what I needed, and not more than I needed was very important.
178	2	0	It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer.
179	2	2	BOUGHT FROM WAL-MART, I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM.
180	2	1	I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.
181	2	1	Games being the main issue.
182	2	0	This computer is good for anything, and it has really superseded my high expectations.
183	2	0	The HD display is sensational, and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me.
184	2	0	At my age, I need this kind of laptop.
185	2	0	More than enough for my use.
186	2	0	I liked the fact that it came with Windows 7, but also included Windows 8 to install later if I need it.
187	2	0	I was nervous at first that I purchased a lemon but the user manual explains how to turn on the keyboard  backlight.
188	2	0	I bought this for my daughter to use for school and homework, it's not a "fast" computer, but it's great for what she needs it for and very light weight!
