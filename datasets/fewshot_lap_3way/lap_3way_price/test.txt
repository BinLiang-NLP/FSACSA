140	3	1	Even though MacBooks are expensive, you will see that they are well worth the money.
141	3	1	While the price may seem high, it is worth every penny with its many perks.
142	3	2	Though, that's pretty much what your paying for -- a well designed device.
143	3	0	-  With that being said, for the price ($800!), you get a nice fast laptop, but if you ask me, it's missing some things that I feel should be automatically included:
144	3	0	It's a steal when considering the specs and performance as well.
145	3	0	By the way...I paid for this particular laptop roughly 2 grand...LOOK AT THE PRICE NOW!
146	3	1	Only thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality!
147	3	0	It is the cheapest product in the line of MacBook's
148	3	0	Battery doesn't hold up to what it said in the description but I got it refurb'd and I imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price (Just a guess).
149	3	1	I would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy.
150	3	1	Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag, and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs.
151	3	1	This, added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money, detracts from the computer's value.
152	3	1	Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer.
153	3	1	You get what you pay for, right?
154	3	1	Now that they are not virus free ([...]l) I see absolutely no benefit to Apple products as they are slower, more expensive, and do not last as long.
155	3	0	I gave this product 5 stars because I have been looking for a MacBook Pro for a long time and I found it here for a wonderful price.
156	3	1	If the price doesn't deter you, you'll find it well worth it in terms of trouble-free operation.
157	3	2	I purchased my Macbook Pro Retina from my school since I had a student discount, but I would gladly purchase it from Amazon for full price again if I had too.
