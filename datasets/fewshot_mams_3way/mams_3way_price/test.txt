0	5	0	The bill was surprisingly inexpensive considering we each had appetizers, an entree, dessert and drinks (alcoholic and non) we also had 3 rounds of shots for the entire table.
1	5	1	I still go often, but the prices went up a little and the service is even slower now that they're always full during dinner hours.
2	5	1	The food at Cafe Asean is to die for, and the prices are unmatchable.
3	5	2	Smiling servers quiz diners with movie trivia, but forget to fill their water glasses.
4	5	1	The food at Parish was tasy and well-prepared, but the portions were absurdly miniscule, especially in proportion to the prices.
5	5	2	considering the prices on the menu, i'd rather go somewhere else where they know how to refill water and real chairs for everyone, something you can even get at mcdonald's.
6	5	1	We were able to reserve a spot at the chef tasting bar with Morimoto who actually called in sick that night, but we were still charged full price.
7	5	2	*There is a pre-theatre dinner menu for early diners that is of great value.
8	5	1	The prixe fix menu was a deal to boost downtown restaurants, atleast we didn't pay the full price.
9	5	0	small price to pay to have dinner on a Saturday night in downtown Manhattan.
10	5	2	The situation was verified by taking 3 dishes that were over an hour late off the bill and free desserts and coffee but the experience left most of us never wanting to go to the supposed hip cool 66 ever again.
11	5	2	When we got our food, the waitress barely said a word as she placed our take-out on the table and grabbed the check.
12	5	1	By dessert, I gave up and sat there hopelessly watching as my rice pudding was snatched away half eaten, only to be replaced immediately with a hefty bill.
13	5	1	The high prices and small portions reflect the hype of a new Battali restaurant as well as the cache that comes with having to make a reservation a week in advance only to wait to be seated.
14	5	1	Although the prices is a bit on the high, you do get big portions for it.
15	5	1	throughout the whole meal, all I kept thinking was AVERAGE, AVERAGE, AVERAGE until the bill came, which was a little more than average,to say the least.
16	5	1	The food is right out of heaven, arrive hungry because the portions are huge but not the prices.
17	5	1	However for the price I paid to have dinner there, you would have thought I ate a horse.
18	5	2	All this Asian fusion craze leaves one feeling like they should've went to an authentic Thai or Indian restaurant for probably 1/3 of the price of Spice Market.
19	5	1	And price is over value for two persons dinner $ 90.
20	5	2	Food was at best, mediocre and when the bill finally came they had nerve to add on 20% gratuity even though there was nothing stated on the menu or anywhere that gratuity was included for a party of 5 (usually a party of 6 is gratuity inclusive).
21	5	2	And once the bill was paid, the bartender kept on giving us drinks.
22	5	2	In any case, the food was quite yummy and on monday nights, they have a prix fixe $25 dinner which is definitely a deal.
23	5	1	For the high price you would pay (dinner for the two could run $80), you sure do get alot.
24	5	2	Not ony did our waiter impose on the dessert we were trying to enjoy to take the money -- he didn't even ask us if we wanted change -- nor did he bring us back any!!!
25	5	1	The Scene Strictly Roots, which opened more than a decade ago as a dietary alternative to Harlem's more cholesterol- and fat-heavy fare, wears its philosophy on its facade: We serve nothing that crawls, walks, swims or flies.
26	5	2	The menu is limited: chicken, rice beans, frozen fish (shrimp, whiting, crab sticks), and french fries, but one receives EXCELLENT value for the money and it is SO WORTH walking down the block for.
27	5	0	Owner Mary Redding keeps things fish camp-y with rod-and-reel rental prices and a list of rules on the backs of the menus.
28	5	2	The other steaks on the menu were $30-$40, so the waiter really should have told them the price of the special.
29	5	1	We waited forever for our bill but did have a nice conversation with one of our waitstaff during our meal.
30	5	2	Try Le Madeleine for a similar price but much better food.
31	5	1	Nothing wrong with the service, either, but don't we all want something more from a dining experience than just average for above-average prices?
32	5	2	Our bill total was only $30 and our waiter threw in a side of linguini (no charge) since the entrees don't come with pasta sides.
33	5	2	For far better fish at the same price (but less interesting roll combinations), try Yama, just around the corner.
34	5	2	The Scene Hunky waiters dub diners darling and it sounds like they mean it.
35	5	1	My friend and I went out for a cigarette, and when we returned, our table had been given to another party- even though our drinks and unpaid bill were still on the table.
36	5	1	What does it say about an establishment and its chef when its policy forces the Price Fixed, Chefs Choice Menu on every party six or greater?
37	5	1	The food was not terrible but with the prices as high as they are, I should expect better.
38	5	2	The best thing though was when they messed up the fish order they not only gave us each a free glass of wine, but they took that fish order off our bill!!!
39	5	2	Frustrated, hand the check back to the server and said 'by the way, never got the dessert and he said i did not realize you wanted dessert'
40	5	1	Mixed drinks were Casino Quality we weren't sure if the sides on our tables were left from the previous diners, but when our steaks (Only one choice on the menu) arrived.
41	5	2	All in all, I would not recommend for the food or drinks but I guess I can't expect better for the prices.
42	5	0	The New Prospect Cafe pretends to be fancy and the prices indicate fancy, but the food is mediocre at best and the service is terrible.
43	5	2	The Food At dinner, a nicely gamey chopped liver mousse, watercress salad with blue cheese and walnuts, and meat loaf with mashed potatoes stand out among the menu's bistro fare.
44	5	2	I'll second the recommedation for the Purity--which has much faster, better service at half the price and a whole lot more selection.
45	5	0	They have even just expanded to include lunch hours at very reasonable prices.
46	5	1	We would rather pay more prices and expect the better food and service.
47	5	0	I've sampled several other dim sum places here, and none feature the winning combination that Triple 8 offers: reasonable prices, large range of standard _and_ less common dim sum, little/no wait (not like the Mott St.
48	5	1	I went with my sister and neither of us had wine so the final bill was a bit shocking.
49	5	1	Only con was the cost -- our dinner for two was $400!
50	5	1	The prices are up there without being over the top but the quality of the food commands it.
51	5	2	Denny's serves a better Grand Slam breakfast--and at a quarter of the price (I paid $21 w/o tip for b-fast--I went back a second time, because the restaurant was highly touted and I thought the first bad experience was a fluke.
52	5	2	Even though we complained several times, they brought us the bill before dessert and the manager came to our table to mention he was closing the place for the night.
53	5	1	Paying that high price, I could have dined at other places with better food and service.
54	5	1	I'm sorry, but the prices at Boi are outrageous for this type of cuisine.
55	5	2	The waitress gave us attitude because we orderred the price fix and not the regular menu.
56	5	2	Once we'd finished eating, it was another 15 minutes before we saw someone who would bring us the check - and after running my credit card, the waitress had the audacity to write cash only in the tip portion of the receipt!
57	5	2	Ignoring the merits of the cuisine (which was par at best), I see no reason why one would pay Da Umberto prices for an okay meal and below average ambience.
58	5	0	Though there are a handful of Japanese a la carte offerings on the menu, the prix fixe is most popular by far.
59	5	1	The food was definitely good, but when all was said and done, I just couldn't justify it for the price (including 2 drinks, $100/person).
60	5	0	Grabbed a lunch here on a weekday and it was reasonably priced, well-portioned and generally well-prepared.
61	5	0	great food, even better price, they also have a dj spinning great music, definitely a must try.
62	5	1	To finish, the cost of the dinner was over-priced.
63	5	1	Although the pricing is on the more expensive side, this is a must try restaurant for its food.
64	5	1	although the food was well-prepared, it was not worth the price, especially when it does not include dessert!
65	5	2	mistake on the check, overly salty morels stuffed with foie gras) but overall, Daniel's dishes are revelations in taste.
66	5	1	Great decor, expensive drinks but worth the price, but the music is bland and the crowd is very cheezy.
67	5	2	For the price and quality of the food, the service should have been a lot better than it was.
68	5	2	), we were not given bread though the couple next to us was, we asked twice for our check and when it came, they forced us to pay the tip in cash so they could get out of paying taxes!
69	5	0	The Food The pan-Italian menu forgoes the appetizer-entree format in favor of fairly priced small plates, which quickly add up.
70	5	2	The first time around, we had the $80 tasting menu, which included some sushi items, which I found to be pretty average, especially for the price.
71	5	2	The only con is the price ($110 for two people for a full meal).
72	5	1	food was just ok,, to many high end places in such a cool lower east side neighborhood,like prune and apizz, prices to high in these places for this hood.
73	5	2	So, get drinks elsewhere, have a nice dinner here, and stop by the package store on the way home where you can get a bottle of Bombay Sapphire for the cost of 2 drinks here.
74	5	2	After dinner our waiter takes the bill and the manager tells him to clear our table so that we could leave.
75	5	1	Although the food was good, it wasn't quite worth the price tag.
76	5	1	The price wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt for the poor service, average food, and uninspired menu selections (choice of tiramisu and strawberries with whipped cream for dessert?!
77	5	0	The food was a meal I could find anywhere else in the city for a better price.
78	5	2	For the cost of the lunch I expected much better service.
79	5	2	We sat there with the check and ordered dessert and more drinks.
80	5	1	If you think the prices are outrageous, just take the family, enjoy the ride and go in and order a few appetizers as prelude to a real dinner.
81	5	1	(Note: Price variations were listed nowhere--and I had asked for a to-go drink, deciding--after paying--to sit at a no-service counter until my drink cooled off.
82	5	2	The host actually came over to my table and told me and my date we had to leave because we already paid our bill.
83	5	0	The Waterview is one of the best diners I've evr been to interms of the quality and taste of the food.
84	5	2	If you are under 24 this might seem to be a great place in the big city but for the rest of us it's just a liitle too chheesy and the food is under par for the price.
85	5	0	I'm a chef (30 years), and I can honestly say that I've finally found Italian food worth eating at a reasonable price.
86	5	1	Sit at the bar (no reservations necessary), eat, talk to the bartender, and enjoy, b/c come dinnertime you will pay quadruple the price (but it's still worth it).
87	5	0	Diners choose between deep banquettes or seats at the bar, which offer a front-row view of the small preparation area and a chance to watch the two chefs as they whip together the elegantly constructed desserts.
88	5	2	We had to ask for the bill twice, and our water was refilled only when we asked for it.
89	5	2	They do make great burgers for the money and give big portions of fries with it.
90	5	1	A blink-and-you-missed, tiny bar lines the lefthand side wall as you enter, which is packed with neighborhood hipsters, but it sadly interferes with the tables filled with dining patrons that are forking out mega bucks for mediocre fare.
91	5	2	I don't know why the place was almost empty until 8PM, but the food and service were perfect for the price.
92	5	1	The food quality is good, but the prices are not worth it!
93	5	0	Ok, so the service can be a little spotty, but despite this Cafe Con Leche has good food, and decent prices.
94	5	1	Trendy decor doesn't make up for the avg food, adequate service and relatively high prices.
95	5	2	Same quality for 1/3 the price and a realistic atmosphere.
96	5	0	The lunch specials are reasonably priced, but I avoid this place when I can only order off the regular menu.
97	5	2	Appetizers took their sweet time in coming, and literally about an hour later we had our main dishes which were very small considering the price.
98	5	2	The only downfall was that our appetizer never showed up, we were apologized to, and it wasn't on our bill, but we also didn't get the jumbo shrimp we were all craving.
99	5	0	Drinks were well priced and the buyback rate was fantastic.
100	5	2	The cool thing about the 3 course price fix is that there is no special or limited menu, you can order ANY app, ANY entree and ANY Dessert.
101	5	0	I haven't tried a lot of their menu however their appitizers are tasty and fairly priced.
102	5	1	The food *was* pretty good, though, (though certainly not worth the prices) so it's worth checking out if you have an expense account to work with.
103	5	1	Also, they upped their prices, so I have their old menu, and was surprised when my bill came to over $5 more than it used to (I know, not a huge deal).
104	5	0	worth every penny, and with the deals on the bar , you could drink and sing to CURRYoke all night,,,,
105	5	0	The prices are decent for this type of food and dining experience.
106	5	1	I loved the food and service here, the only downside was the decor was dissappointing and the prices are a bit high (about $30 for an entree.
107	5	2	I went to Ciao on a Saturday evening and the food was not up to the price asked for.
108	5	2	Knock off 15-20% of the prices and you have a decent night out.
109	5	2	had to ask the host for the check because the waitress was sitting at another table taking their order.
110	5	0	However for one appetizer, three entree's, one shared dessert, and two bottles of white, the bill was a cool $100!
111	5	2	Perhaps it was because the 20% tip was already added to the bill, but the waiter brought us plain gazpacho without any of the other ingredients described on the menu; later, when we complained, he brought us saucers of garnish instead of new bowls of the soup properly prepared.
112	5	0	Reasonable prices for Cuban food in the city.
113	5	0	Although the food was good, the way our waiter treated us was so rude and bad-mannered that it almost ruined our night and he even asked us to give him a better tip!!!
114	5	1	I thought the service was a little slow and not attentive enough for the price but other than that I'll be back when I can afford to spend $60 on dinner!
115	5	1	I expected high prices at Nello, but as I looked at the menu my eyes became as large as the Birkin Mary-Kate has been seen toting around these days--$18 for soup, $22 for a plate of mixed greens, $40 for pasta.
116	5	1	Someone should tell these people that high prices on the menu does not make your restaurant better.
117	5	2	I had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the price paid, I expected it to have some type of flavor.
118	5	0	The atmosphere is nice, food is really worth it, especially for such prices, but service sucks:  I first ordered 2 different martinis and never got the one I asked for;  they brought the wrong dishes -although it was quick!- and then we had to ask for chopsticks to be able to eat our dishes.
119	5	2	I had to stare out waitress down to get our check and also we were charge.
120	5	1	The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.
121	5	0	BTW, the prices are very affordable, which make the mediocer service tolerable.
122	5	0	ran ~$30 ($12 for the taco, 8 for the rb, 10 fir the drink) plus tax and a very deserved tip.
123	5	2	When we got our bill the drinks were full priced and when we asked, our waitress said that there is no happy hour on the roof.
124	5	1	The food is decent, but for what the bill comes to, it's just not worth it.
125	5	1	Charging full price for half pie toppings, and refusing delivery (1 block) for orders under $20.
126	5	0	It was Au Bar meets 'Absolutely Fabulous' meets a Versace Outlet Sale.
127	5	1	Overall, it is a nice place and if you don't mind possible attitude and the not-so-cheap prices, it is a great place to meet for coffee or drinks (they have a nice selection of that too!
128	5	1	The pricing isn't quite clear and look out for that asterisk on the menu where they add on that extra 6-8 bucks.
129	5	0	Good value for money--especially the $7 lunch special for 2 courses.
130	5	2	Besides, they used to be much more accommodating when I used to request a jalebi paratha instad of a plain naan as part of the brunch price.
131	5	0	The service was good and the price was decent but it wasn't enough to overcome the bland tasting food and the bland decor of the restaurant.
132	5	1	Arriba Arriba has much better food, margs, and atmosphere with slightly higher prices, but well worth it.
133	5	1	I was thinking I am gonna have a nice dinner in that place that a friend of mine recommended to me , but beside the expensive prices that it has was nothing more.
134	5	1	Expect to get average food, a big bill and lots of attitude from the service.
135	5	2	After 10 minutes of waiting, he finally returned to the table and snootily explained to us that the wine he had opened was actually better and more expensive (not yet on the menu, of course), but he would charge us the price of the bottle we had originally ordered.
136	5	2	Oh yeah, the food's just alright for the price.
137	5	1	When we followed the waiter to get back the card, the Manager explained that their machine did work, but someone else's bill was charged on our card (total charge=$140).
138	5	1	The service was warm, but it took forever to get the check.
139	5	2	The atmosphere was a+, until a friend and I were rudely interrrupted and rushed out by the attendant at the door when the check was only returned to us just 5 mins.
140	5	1	Evening started out nice w/ complimentary glass of champagne, but turned sour as mussels were extremely overcooked, steak came in kid size portion smothered with sauce and owner recommended a wine special off the standard wine menu that was double the price of the most expensive bottle but made no effort to describe the wine as extremely special or significantly more expensive that what they typically serve.
141	5	0	The prices weren't bad though - dinner ended up at $80 with tip and we had a couple drinks as well.
142	5	1	Our cocktails were ok but at ridiculous dance club prices.
143	5	2	We (naturally) asked for a discount when the bill came, and our waitress disappeared for a moment and offered us.
144	5	1	The food is great and I found it to be fresh and the prices are below to average compared to other Greek Restaurants.
145	5	2	Summary - good food which they rush you through and do everything to up your bill.
146	5	1	The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.
147	5	0	Upon reading the $44 prix fixe menu (a fair price for good food), we realized half of the Appetizers and Entrees required an additional supplement ranging from five dollars to $105!
148	5	1	I'm not going to trash the place simply because I had a bad experience there, but here's the facts: the food is very good, the portions are small-to-medium, and the prices are large.
149	5	0	It's very reasonably priced considering the size of portions.
150	5	0	The food was very good but the portions are pretty small, so while the prices are low, the place is not quite a bargain it seems to be.
151	5	2	For the price you pay, you get good quality and deliciously thin sliced beef.
152	5	0	This is definitely not a place to come for lunch because you can get the same food from a corner deli at half the price they charge here.
153	5	2	I had the lentils and cous cous for lunch the next day because my friend and I had appetizers before our entrees-- portions are pretty decent for the price, and tasty to boot.
154	5	1	Growling at us when we asked for water is one thing, but to just lie and make NO effort to satisfy, or apologize at these moderately high prices ($12.
155	5	0	I looked for months for a reasonably priced place that could accommodate about 40 people for a wedding rehearsal dinner on a Friday night.
156	5	1	I had dinner here with a few friends recently, and while I must admit that the food and service was okay, the prices simply did not match the environment and cuisine.
157	5	2	Although the sushi was fresh, I was disappointed with the size of the portions for the price.
158	5	1	But the price tag was high, and the food was comparable to a Las Vegas buffet for flavor and quality.
159	5	1	The food is just ok, not really memorable and not what you expect for the price but I guess the atmosphere is what you pay for.
160	5	1	The food was good but for the prices, it was definitely not worth it.
161	5	1	the regular prices looked pretty expensive (~$15 per appetizer, ~$35 per entre) so the restaurant week menu (at $35pp) seemed like a sweet deal.
162	5	1	This is definitely a special occasion spot, unless you don't mind a hefty bill, but rest assured that either way, it's well worth it.
163	5	1	Food and service were very good but prices were a bit high for the portions.
164	5	2	The service was really bad at several points our waiter would just leave for a cigarette for like 10 minutes while we waited for him to get us another drink or even pay the bill.
165	5	2	We ordered the Tuna a la carte and Wild Salmon and chicken breast on the Prix Fixe.
166	5	0	The decor is not special at all but their food and amazing prices make up for it.
167	5	1	Rather you are paying rock bottom price for a meal that could cost you triple any where else.
168	5	2	I ordered a medium Cub burger and it came out well done, not that my server would have noticed since we didn't see her again until she brought the check.
169	5	0	The menu sticks to standard Italian dishes--linguine with clam sauce, chicken parmigiana, and fettuccine Alfredo--but the reasonable prices add to the charm.
170	5	1	WAY OVER PRICED , HAD MUCH BETTER MEALS FOR JUST OVER HALF THE PRICE IN PLACES JUST AS NICE.
171	5	2	The waiter kept pestering us for our order even though we were among the last diners.
172	5	0	We reserved the downstair lounge for private parties and the price was fairly reasonable.
173	5	1	Warning Service is decent, but it takes forever to get the check.
174	5	0	It was also very reasonably priced, we had 4 bottles of wine, appetizers, dinner, and coffee and our bill was just over 50 per person.
175	5	2	It took a long time for the waiter to bring the check and we had to flag him down.
176	5	0	You must think that the quality is poor for them to sell it for such a low price.
177	5	2	Waiter dropped check on table while I was in the middle of handing my wife her anniversary present.
178	5	2	maybe its the cost of top ingredients but 17.
179	5	1	One price for dinner left for no surprises.
180	5	2	Great deal for lunch; came to something like $11 with tip and tax!
181	5	1	Order ended up being double the price of a normal lunch.
182	5	1	The rest of the meal was good, but a little over priced for Chinese take out style food.
183	5	1	The drinks were water down and the only BIG thing was the bill.
184	5	0	Flavorful Indian favorites like vegetable pakora, lamb tikka masala and tandoori chicken, as well as unexpected offerings such as Alaska king crab legs and fried coconut shrimp, are served at extremely reasonable prices.
185	5	1	Prices are not cheap, but not expensive but the meal is worth every penny.
186	5	1	The characters were very entertaining, and while the prices are a little steep, it is well worth the cost.
187	5	2	Beautiful rooms filled with beautiful people, but expensive for what it is ($68 prix fixe), limited menu, tiny portions, reeeeeeeally slow service, undercooked potatoes with the cod, less than fascinating desserts.
188	5	0	It's not going to win any awards for its decor, but the food is good, the portions are big, and the prices are low.
189	5	1	The food is ok, but not worth the prices.
190	5	1	1 hour for water, 1 hour for drinks, 1 hour for food, as you can see we were there for almost 5 hours before our bill came, not for enjoyment but pure frustration.
191	5	2	And the waitstaff has very little knowledge of the food, they served me the wrong dish and no one could identify what it was that they gave me, someone said pork chop, someone said lamb, and then they insisted it should be fine since it was the same price.
192	5	2	small portions, average food 6) we ask for the check, the waiter says, ok, and 5 minutes later asks if we want coffee or dessert.
193	5	1	The food is average the prices high and the whole experience was very upsetting.
194	5	1	prices were low, you got a good deal, sushi was ok; everybody wins.
195	5	2	After leaving the traditional 15% tip, the waiter ran after us for half a block to confront.
196	5	0	Oh, the prices were not so bad either, we paid $58 for chicken, salmon, one sushi roll, one ceasar salad and soda :).
197	5	1	) The food was good, but not at all worth the price.
198	5	2	One of the waitstaff spilled a huge drink on the floor that splattered everyone nearby, no offering of apology was made or to foot the drycleaning bill and no comp was offered either.
199	5	1	The kicker was when there were three items on our check that were priced higher than stated on the menu and by the server.
200	5	1	For the price I paid for a cup of Bustelo coffee w/ milk I could buy 2 vacumed packs for 3 bucks.
201	5	0	Three course meal for lunch was $13, the prices for dinner were just as great!
202	5	1	Before our server took our drink order she told us that the prices on the menu were going to be higher that night because of the party.
203	5	2	My greek salad cost about $9 and for that price, I would not have expected chopped olive (as opposed to whole), and shredded bits of lettuce.
204	5	2	the soups were superb and only $2 a bowl, and the entire dinner, with beers, cost less than $30 for two people.
205	5	2	We are laidback diners and as we've both waited tables, we tend to be forgiving of irregular service.
206	5	2	The bill came out to quite a lot though, considering there were 14 of us some of us ordered way too many drinks.
207	5	1	The food was awful and took forever to arrive - which considering the limited menu, few diners and the fact that we ordered chili, mac cheese and a grill cheese was annoying.
208	5	2	Food and Service of the same high quality elsewhere in NY would have been twice the cost.
209	5	2	There is NO waiting area - waiters, diners,and staff all converge in a tight space.
210	5	2	Lastly, the bartender didnt give me detailed bill, just my credit card receipt to sign.
211	5	2	The irony of it all is that I tried the fish and chips at a sports bar across the street the following week, 1/2 the price (w/ fries included), and the portion was bigger and much tastier.
212	5	2	brunch menu had nice variety to choose from, miniblueberrrymuffins better than some bakeries, included in their price mimosa/bloody mary's were nice.
213	5	1	The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size.
214	5	2	The only thing whihc i (and my partner) never heard before was: the waitress mentioned the price of the specials (?
215	5	0	The Food This Cajun-Italian menu is lengthier than its Manhattan counterparts--here, adventuresome diners can still design their own pies, but they can also feast on oversized plates of peel-and-eat old bay shrimp and cajun spaghetti with meatballs enlivened with andouille sausage.
216	5	0	In Short It's a bakery, takeout place and cafe all in one, and thanks to dishes prepared using the same ingredients stocked at famed gourmet food emporium, Zabar's, prices and quality are upscale.
217	5	1	The food was certainly fine, although prices were high by any standard, with dinner for four being over $300 without drinks.
218	5	0	The price is cheap - 5 dumplings for $1.
219	5	2	The portions were pretty small for the price, I thought, and I never got the coffee I ordered.
220	5	2	One waitress was downright rude when we asked for the check.
221	5	2	When the bill came, both appetizers were charged even though we had one bite of the first and it should not have served competely overcooked.
222	5	2	Diners sit around large tables where chefs ostentatiously chop, slice, stir-fry and grill.
223	5	1	Interestingly, cost only becomes truly apparent when dinner is over, as there is no menu before that presented for deserts.
224	5	2	For a menu in a similar price range with some similar items, but mostly unique entrees, try the less formal Toast 13 or so blocks north on the same side of Broadway.
225	5	2	The waiter simply comped off our appetizer and then stayed away for the rest of the night--we waited an additional twenty minutes after we were done eating for the check!
226	5	2	Also, be wary of what time of the day you go; around dinnertime, the restaurant becomes a jungle of diners and hustling waitresses.
227	5	0	we ordered simple salads, which were outrageous in price and def.
228	5	2	(So long that it prevented me from increasing their sales by getting more possible drinks) If i just saw my one waiter the whole night I would have known who to talk too.
229	5	1	Mojitos were good and prices werent bad but sides should be included in price as portions are tiny.
230	5	0	I go to Hing Won pretty often for lunch because it is close by and the prices are right.
231	5	0	The prices are reasonable but they don't have a sushi lunch.
232	5	2	Food is okay for the price, however there is definitely better thai restaurants!!
233	5	1	I realized that you dont have to wait hours and pay crazy prices for food.
234	5	2	With one drink each, apps, entrees, and three desserts (nothing great) the bill came to $200 for four.
235	5	2	Our waiter snubbed us when we asked if there was dessert (there wasn't), and my meal would have been the same price had it not been restaurant week.
236	5	0	26 seats also has the most reasonable prices in NYC, it is a true gem.
237	5	1	For the price and quality of the food we got, I would not dine here again.
238	5	0	He was not accommodating at all and the handful of dishes I sampled that night failed to compare to anything you would find elsewhere in the city for less than half the price.
239	5	1	At first I was shocked by the price, but the excellent and friendly service from our waiter Jack was great and the duck salad was the best ever.
240	5	0	The menu features such sumptuous fare as lobster ravioli in a light aurora sauce, double-cut grilled veal chop with an aromatic salsa verde, and octopus salad with steamed potato, red onions, and caper berries.
241	5	2	But the karaoke downstairs is the real draw: You and your friends can sing yourself silly in absolute privacy, for nothing more than the cost of dinner and drinks.
242	5	2	After some good food and spotty service, my friends and I were surprised to get a bill that had a 20% tip included post-tax.
243	5	2	I for one do not plan to go back, there are many other places in Manhattan that have just as good food if not better, at the same prices with much better service.
244	5	1	The fondue was good, but not worth the very expensive price tag.
245	5	1	Why would anyone ever go here when the same food (and menu) is double the price of Baba and Jaya in Chinatown.
246	5	1	The food was good but not worth the price.
247	5	0	The ambience is diner-like and the wait staff is rushed, but at these prices, I can't complain.
248	5	2	Perhaps I chose the wrong place, not fully appreciating that another reviewer's remark that diners here won't be rushed could translate to my timely-arrived party having to wait 'til 9:50PM to be seated for a 9PM Saturday reservation.
249	5	1	We wouldn't bother quibbling over the price of a few drinks anyway but I wonder why they would offer if they weren't intending to back it up.
250	5	2	The waiter ignored us for ten minutes, the restaurant was empty, got our drink orders wrong, got one main dish order wrong and the disappeared for another ten minutes before we could get the check.
251	5	2	All in all, it was a decent meal but dinner for two came to $172 with tip.
252	5	2	Even without this hiccup, the service seemed very amateur--not snooty, as I've read in other reviews--just nowhere near as good as it should be given the price of the meal.
253	5	2	In my experience, Olympic Flame, a traditional NYC Greek coffee shop, offers good value for one's money in terms of food cost but passable to rude service, depending on who you get.
254	5	1	If the food is out of your price range then at least go for happy hour for a drink - although the drinks cost a bit more then the average happy hour bar after you receive one you would agree that it is worth it.
255	5	0	In fact you can find their menu offerings at other places for better qualities and lower prices.
256	5	0	The food as always was fantastic, and the pricing was moderate although I was not happy about the 18% gratuity being added for parties over 6, especially after the horrible service we recieved.
257	5	0	food for fancy prices; menu consisted of one page; antipasto, and pizza; that was pretty much it; the other 3 pages was to my surprize the wine list.
258	5	1	I always thought the food was decent, but not spectacular and the price fair, but no bargain.
259	5	2	My Moon spent all their money on an architect/interior designer and forgot about the chef.
260	5	0	For the money, it's a dependable and fun place to get sushi - bring friends and share the 2 for 1 rolls (they have to be 2 of the same.
261	5	0	) I'm sticking with Cafe Mozart--which has the same desserts, bigger slices, and lower prices!
262	5	2	The bill came out to like $100pp, and noone touched their food, and drinks were left untouched because after the first bite/sip you want to never touch it again.
263	5	2	DINERS serve better french toast than Balthazar.
264	5	2	The waitstaff was helpful but watch out, after you pay your hefty bill managment will ask you to leave if they think you've lingered too long.
265	5	0	The menu alternates between typical American fare (salads, potato skins, Angus burgers and grilled chicken) and modestly international cuisine like fajitas, wraps and pot stickers.
266	5	2	The pro's: Good ambience,service The Con's: For the 4 to 5 star price (200 dollars for 2 people which included 2 drinks each, an appetizer, main course, and a hsared dessert), the food and presentation was just average.
267	5	0	i went here on a whim and found out you could get sushi for half price kind of like happy hour.
268	5	1	The only redeeming factor of the night was the dessert which was very good but certainly not worth the cost of an overall horible experience.
269	5	1	Not the ideal spot when you're really hungry -- the plates are tiny and the prices not (like every other upscale tapas place).
270	5	2	The waitress only stopped at our table to take our order and pick up the check.
271	5	0	The prices seemed reasonable with entrees ranging from $14-$25.
272	5	0	the prices are right and i strongly recommend this place for any time of day: early breakfast or late night snack.
273	5	2	The waitress came three times: to take our order, to bring the order, and to bring the check.
274	5	2	It's got above-average diner and italian fare, and it's right near the subway.
275	5	0	Portion was just a bit small compare with other restaurant but the price was lower than usualy as well (7.
276	5	2	We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off.
277	5	2	You can undoubtedly get better food and service for the price at other places, but certainly not with those views!
278	5	2	Not including the tip for our server, who we saw twice in an hour?
279	5	2	Service was prompt, although at times the waiters seemed to be spending more time dealing with the overflow from the bar than the diners (ever heard of cocktail waiters).
280	5	2	I guess Mars 2112 keeps the food bland for the family fare, but it only serves to detract from its overall experience.
281	5	1	Worth the trip and the wait (and the higher than average price)?
282	5	1	As for the food, apart from the Chef's Omakase, the appetizers and rolls are just below mediocre for the price they charged.
283	5	1	Not only did they refuse to give me any milk but they charged me full price ($9) for plain udon noodles - no broth, veggies, or meat just wet noodles in a bowl.
284	5	0	Ok, it's not greasy steak and juicy burger good, but it's a light healthy fare, if you are into that kind of stuff.
285	5	1	The food had a somewhat elevated price tag but but fair considering the Nobu origin - The cocktails highly recommended including the spide and lobster roll - we were well plated and did not encounter any arragance from the staff - maybe the other student reviewers are used to cafeteria service.
286	5	2	huuge portions, which made it much easier paying the $350 bill.
287	5	2	Low-fat and low-carb options (such as flatbread) lure in health-conscious diners, while everyone else can sink their teeth into warm, crispy baguettes piled with mesquite chicken or smoked turkey, Philly cheese steaks and more.
288	5	0	And Mondays fajita are half price all night.
289	5	1	And although I've noticed that the prices have gone up a little since they opened, it's still a great menu.
290	5	2	When we received the bill, we asked the manager to do something about the drinks, considering how poor the service was and her reply was, Well, you got them!
291	5	2	You get plenty of food for the price, enough leftovers for lunch and they actually serve garlic chicken with lots of chicken and chinese vegetables.
292	5	1	The waiter, and someone at the next table, were both correct when they said that the lobster was delicious, but I though the price was a little steep.
293	5	0	Yes, the prices SEEM afordable, but the portions are so small that you end up spending $100+ just to fill 2 people and get a couple drinks.
294	5	1	The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.
295	5	1	There are no price listed in the menu, and she will not provid them with a smile.
296	5	2	The menu can give you price shock but the food, service and drinks are worth every stinking penny.
297	5	2	However, the service was so excellent, we added $10 to the tip!
298	5	2	Our food was delivered in a timely fashion but if you wanted another drink or your check you had to hunt down your server.
299	5	2	It's a small and quaint place so have your expectations in check, but that doesn't mean anything bad - know going in that you are gonna eat some serious food!
300	5	2	The food is very good for the price.
301	5	0	Superfine is my preferred destination in the city when I'm looking for a casual, hip atmosphere, extraordinary food at decent prices and/or just a place to get a good drink, chat with the bartender and shoot some (free) pool.
302	5	2	$25 prix fixe sounds like a good deal, but dinner was still $100 for two, the portions were small, and the ($35) wine, clearly where the money is made, mediocre.
303	5	2	My only complaint is that the place is over crowded on weekends, but that's the price you pay for having such great food.
304	5	2	This happened while many diners were enjoying their meal and it was rudes.
305	5	2	They gave us desert menus but never came back for a desert order, instead we had to ask for the check and a bus boy retreived it for us.
306	5	2	The atmosphere was embracing and enticing and the costs of the meal, $45 to $55 in value.
307	5	0	Blue Ribbon Sushi has far more than a cult following, packed daily from Noon till 3 AM, with hipsters, celebrities, Sashimi Lovers, and of course SOHO locals, it's breath taking menu, Superb Fare, Lengthy Sake List, and pro seating system have earned it a 5 STAR rating with The Sushi Times: 6 years running.
308	5	2	Park your trench coat at the coat check and be prepared for fine dining, expert / attentive table service and a delectable cuisine.
309	5	1	Again, since I go out to dinner several times a week in NY, I am used to paying high prices and do not mind at all.
310	5	1	Besides the price, here are some other annoyances: bleaching the floors during the dinner and automatically charging you 20% gratuity on your credit card without your knowledge.
311	5	0	The food is not five star but the prices reflect that.
312	5	0	The price was right too--I spent under $30 for my entree and two drinks.
313	5	2	There was no price on the menu and the waitress recommended it.
314	5	1	The prices did not reflect the quality of the meal.
315	5	0	The Food The daily-changing menu, scrawled on large dry-erase boards, offers a blend of haute cuisine and Texas roadhouse fare.
316	5	2	The waiter asked us several times after dinner whether we had paid our bill yet, and after we had, he came over to make sure that we hadn't just hidden it from him or something.
317	5	2	Second, the value was great; after ordering a ton of food and several drinks, the bill still came to less than $40 a person (though I suspect that the nice manager might have given us a few freebees!
318	5	2	After reading the negative sushi reviews, my boyfriend and I opted for their Korean fare.
319	5	1	We walked out the door with only a drink in each of us and the bill was still over $100.
320	5	2	It took us 20 minutes to get a check, despite many attempts at meaningful eye contact with the wait staff.
321	5	2	Our waiter disappeared entirely, our food, when we were finally able to order it, arrived without plates (we had to go and track down a busboy to get them), and when we were finished, we couldn't get the check, even after walking across the restaurant to request it.
322	5	2	Ofcourse the restaurant is new and perhaps they have some kinks to work out, but it for the same price you can get a higher caliber brunch at Banania or Cafe Luluc on Smith St.
323	5	1	Fantastic flavor, but certainly not worth the high price of the small glass.
324	5	1	Bill for three with 7 plates, glass of sangria each and coffee and one dessert was 45 each with tip - not too bad but a tad overpriced for the serving size of the dishes.
325	5	0	After being given a bad table at Becco and leaving there, we walked around and decided on Da Rosina because the price was right and the menu looked good.
326	5	0	Sure the service isn't the best but the food is tasty and the prices are great.
327	5	1	I just think the prices are high for the type of food the kitchen turns out as well as the portion sizes.
328	5	2	We asked for the check and had to wait 20mins for the waitress to come back and take our card.
329	5	2	As for price, there are plenty of Shanghai restaurants in Chinatown that are just as inexpensive with better food and without a doubt much better customer service.
330	5	2	Unfortunately, service was slow and when our server noticed we had not received our entree he comp'ed us two delightful margaritas - AND charged us only for appetizers , thereby cutting our bill in half.
331	5	1	I've had the same steak at Peter Lugers for double the price.
332	5	1	I would only recommend this restaurant to a friend if waiting at least 40 minutes for your RESERVATION is acceptable, and you don't mind paying for relatively standard fare.
333	5	2	For the price ($8), the quality of the buffet is great!
334	5	1	When I look at the menu I was surprised at the relatively high price compared with other korean restaurants.
335	5	2	As we were wrapping up a very rushed meal--appetizers were barely started when the entrees arrived crowding a table for two at which three were crammed--the hostess charged over and grabbed a half-full wine glass declaring thanks ladies, I'll get your check.
336	5	2	I was accompanied by foodies, yet the waiter treated the few questions people had about the menu as if he was dealing with diners who had never eaten at a decent restaurant.
337	5	1	i would not go after the early bird b/c its not worth it, find better food for full prices.
338	5	2	Waiter ignored us, never asked if we needed anything, never received a dessert menu or asked if we wanted coffee, or even the check.
339	5	0	To make matters worse, the waitress followed us out, and demanded that we leave a better tip.
340	5	1	The presentation of some of the dishes and desserts were great but taste and quality of the food was sub-par especially for the prices that we were paying.
341	5	1	Since we already have our drinks there is no choice, so we are forced to pay full price.
342	5	1	They charge $24 for entrees and ask additional price of $3 for rice or $6 for vegetables as side dish!
343	5	1	If you want great Italian food, fairly price, good service, in Brooklyn, a couple of subway stops from Union Square,(where you should complain about the prices) go to Al Di La.
344	5	0	A few of us went the other night for cocktails (half price!)
345	5	0	There is no way the food and service here are worth the prices they charge.
346	5	1	Could have gone to Pastis for a salad three times the size for the same price.
347	5	1	Where else can you go to get freshly made Italian food at ridiculously low prices?
348	5	0	The dinner menu promises creative-yet-comforting fare, such as beef brisket in a red wine and fig sauce, panko-crusted tofu over hijiki salad, and a six-spice beef burger.
349	5	1	Do not go to this restaurant unless you like paying high prices for small protions, ordering a drink that arrives 20 minutes later, or ordering a meal only to get the side dish 5 minutes after you're done.
350	5	1	Nevertheless, after waiting for an eternity to be seated, we finally sit down and wait for our menus, wait for our food, and to our surprise the food was minimal relative to the price.
351	5	0	I can only speak as a non-Indian, since we both come from an originally American palate, but Indian cuisine, both Northern and Southern, is my favorite non-Western cuisine, and I'm always on the prowl for something delicious and worth the price.
352	5	2	Compared to New York prices, the menu seems reasonably priced (it is not cheap like Fridays, but is reasonable compared to top quality food experiences in this city).
353	5	2	We were just settling the bill, when a waiter I can only assume held a controlling interest in the restaurant (else he would've been fired long ago) came to the table and demanded to know why someone (our friend who'd briefly left to use the restroom) had left her beer half-full.
354	5	1	(dissapointed) Over price for a lunch menu, including the lunch specials(be smart.
355	5	1	Although the prices are kind of high for lunch the atmosphere is nice.
356	5	1	The prices were outrageous, but we assumed the quality would be commensurate, so we ordered.
357	5	2	Food was fresh yet dull, especially for the price ($12-14 appetizers; $22-$27 entrees).
358	5	0	I have dined here for over 20 years and I know the management will NOT compromise the cuisine for any haute trendy fare.
359	5	2	Those of you who are sick of the standard Italian fare will be blown away by the food at Arezzo.
360	5	1	I will be back not only because the price was so unbelievable but the atmosphere was just plain COOL and the food was spectacular.
361	5	1	The average price of a meal (app, entree, 1 drink and tip) is probably around $28.
362	5	2	Still the bill was close to $300(with 1 bottle of lower-priced wine).
363	5	2	Get plenty on food for the price.
364	5	2	Our server paid little attention to refilling our drinks, the runners brought the entrees out less than 1 minute after the appetizer, the server delivered another table's bill to us before we had even had entrees, and my partner's entree has a very noticable hair on his plate.
365	5	2	the space is very comfortable - they don't rush you - you don't have a server holding your bill in their hand asking if you'd like anything else.
366	5	2	When I went for sunday brunch, not only was the food bland and cold, they didn't even bother to clear the plates once they brought the bill.
367	5	1	After hearing all of the specials, you would think they were twice as much as the menu prices (as other places do).
368	5	1	I ordered chicken vindaloo, the delivery took about an hour, and it cost me $13 with tip.
369	5	0	no dish on brunch menu over $11 - definitely worth the price.
370	5	0	Id say a little better than most Thai Ive eaten, and the menu had an astounding selection, which isnt bad for such a reasonable price.
371	5	2	This set off our critical eye: ceramic bowls having edges higher than the table votives hid the fact that the food was presented cafeteria-style; a rolling-eyed waiter pushing water; the awkward Italian menue gimmick; and the bill.
372	5	2	After admitting that the items on the bill were not in line with the menu, the manager reserved the right to price at her own discretion!
373	5	2	For the prices, the food is decidedly lackluster, and the service, unless you are a regular, can be quite rude.
374	5	0	Check out the little room with the red seats and candles and get a green dragon saketini - it's worth the NYC cocktail price ($14).
375	5	1	After all that, it is average food at best with huge bill at the end.
376	5	1	The food was good overall, but unremarkable given the price.
377	5	1	On the top of everything at the end of the dinner the waiter gave us the wrong check.
378	5	2	The waitress came back with the bill and money (with a calculator) and asked for more tips.
379	5	2	Chef Shea Gallante takes up residence in the former kitchen of Waxman, now walled off from the diners but visible through glass service doors.
380	5	1	Service was fine and the food delivered in reasonable time given the crowd, but for the price I was disappointed.
381	5	1	for the prices that are on the regular menu we were expecting something more upscale and less generic.
382	5	0	I checked this place out during the blizzard, and was thrilled to discover the $12 early bird price fixe (until 6:30 PM) -- appetizer, entree, dessert, and soda.
383	5	0	With 5 items on the menu and prices this low, you'd think turnover would be a priority -- think again!!!
384	5	0	When one compares the quality of the food to some of the city's other italian restaurants, and then particularly when one factors in the very reasonable prices here, I feel that this restaurant comes out a winner.
385	5	2	When it came time to get the check, they couldn't seem to determine which of the servers had it.
386	5	2	Fortunately the waitress was very ncie about this, and did not give me a hassle about taking the cake off the final bill.
387	5	0	The menu offers a lineup of USDA prime steaks at higher-end prices paired with sides such as crab cakes, fried oysters and onion rings.
388	5	2	My first and LAST visit included a waiter telling me We're casual- pour your own wine and then handing me a check with a place for the Captain's tip.
389	5	0	Some of the food is the Italian American red-sauce variety - fine if you're stuck in the past, but, there are also a number of very good, far more authentic Italian items at most reasonable prices.
390	5	2	As the night rolls on the place turns into a bar/lounge so the wait staff is constantly rushing you to eat up and move out, not the kind of atmosphere you want for the price you are paying for your entree.
391	5	2	The staff were very friendly, the prices were relatively average, not bad, and the food was great.
392	5	2	I paid $12 including tax tip for a beef entree with salad, noodles, rice, a fried dumpling, many free appetizers and a glass of ice water.
393	5	2	It was the WORST Sangria ever, and their house drink has just a shot of Malibu rum, and at a price of $9 you want more than a shot of a 40% alcohol.
394	5	2	Waiters were pretty slow, didnt refill my glass of water until I was about to leave, and I had to ask several times to get the check and the slices of lemon.
395	5	2	The Scene This cosmopolitan cousin of the legendary Harry's Bar in Venice is frequented by a wealthy and insouciant crowd, the types who don't bother looking at menu prices when they order.
396	5	1	The food is average, at best (I have been repeatedly underwhelmed by the mediocre fare) and the service is only good if Elaine is within range.
397	5	0	Prices are reasonable, probably $55/pp with appetizers, main course, dessert and a drink.
398	5	1	I order the Jerk Chicken full price off the menu.
399	5	1	However, the food, once you get over the price, was very good.
400	5	0	The ambience isn't great but the food is so tasty and so reasonably priced that it's definitely a fun date place if you want to get a bunch of stuff and sample.
401	5	1	Although the sides at Lugers are delicious (the bacon is out of this world) the steak is entirely priced way too high.
402	5	2	The wait staff rushed us through our meal, took away our food before we were finished (even though we told them we were still eating) and then, as we were lingering over the bill, asked us to leave.
403	5	1	the trendy atmosphere and high price fooled me into thinking that somehow the food would be innovative.
404	5	2	The waitresses and the diners have to scream at one another to give an order.
