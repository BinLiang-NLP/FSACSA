I found that the food variety was great, and the waitress was very accommodating to my vegan boyfriend describing all items' ingredients and how you may request more of what YOU like, creating a unique experience.
I went back (with my cold soups) They said they would have to make me another dish since they couldn't scrape off the unwanted ingredients.
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC.
the tables are in the back and the ambience was less to be desired.
I dined in the Main Dining Room which is surrounded by authentic Spanish decorations.
THE DECOR HAS BEEN UPDATED TO A FULL BLOWN RESTAURANT BUT THE QUALITY AND THE QUANTITY HASN'T CHANGED.
Unfortunately, the food along with the unhelpful service doesn't make up for the atmosphere.
Heck even if they had awful service and atmosphere I would still come to this place for their dumplings, luckly that is not the case.
I had been to Blue Fin previously for drinks and appetizers and thought the atmosphere was very good (expecially for people watching).
The atmosphere was nice (tables were a bit too close together) and trendy, but waiters seemed rushed.
There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.
The atmosphere was really nice and inviting but our waiter was awful!
The decor is sparse and elegant, the service warm (though my waitress was occasionally difficult to find), and the sushi fresh.
I waited 15 minutes for the waiter to take the bill from me and finally I got fed up with him walking past our table I had to start waving the bill in the air and finally some other waitress took our bill.
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.
the atmosphere is trendy, i think it's better to come here for a drink rather than dinner.
The atmosphere was warm, sexy, and very romantic but the lighting wasn't good for reading the menu.
I just got back from dinner from this UES hotspot - it is like a home away from home - delicious meals and a salad dressing that sometimes they let me have a tiny container of for my lunch at work salads - the price/ atmosphere/ cocktails (FULL BAR!!!
The decor maybe great for young kids but as an adult this place was an horrible experiance, it didn't bring the kid in me.
The four of us were seated in the outdoors patio(not requested) and suffered through a muddled menu, indifferent food, a below average waiter, as well as excessive noise, wind and cold.
The service was not the greatest, but the place is huge and it has a nice setting.
I have to agree with the previous review that the atmosphere isn't much, but Mister Falafel can't be beat for quick, delicious, cheap takeout.
Charming atmosphere that seats probably no moroe than 35.
The Food The menu seems quirky, but upon a closer look ingredients are familiar and made into appealing combinations, with influences from Maine to the Mediterranean.
employees not fighting with each other in front of clients 3 having ALL the ingredients for the meals they have on there menue.
A hard-drinking, upscale crowd, holding conversations over loud Latin jazz music, packs the small, open dining room and attached bar.
The decor reminds me of Miami nightclubs, and we sat in a cool communal strip, where you share your table with people.
Good place for groups of four or large parties but it is not a cozy/intimate setting for 2 although the jazz helps!
We objected at the ill flavor of the drinks and the manager was not understanding at all.
18 has a cozy romantic atmosphere that's very comfortable to enjoy myself in; whether I want to have a drink at the bar or get together with a group of friends for dinner, suitable accomodations are available.
The limited number of toppings prevented the sogginess described by other reviewers and allowed the intense flavors from the fresh ingredients; sauce, mozarella, basil and black olives to really shine through, without being watered down from too many extra toppings.
I managed to get the last reservation at 11:15pm during the week, and, upon entering the restaurant, my boyfriend and I were seated next to each other, hardly a romantic atmosphere!
The ambiance is nice, but the wait staff was rude and unattentive.
If you like a cleaner (more generic) flavor then other places may provide the norm.
even if you have to wait for a spot at the bar to wait for your table, the music and design of the space create an ambiance that is simultaneously chic and comfortable - something extraordinarily difficult to find in this city.
In Short Despite the tacky Hellenic decor, replete with faux columns and signs of the zodiac carved into plaster walls, this Greek restaurant and bar bursts with authenticity when it comes to menu and atmosphere.
So when i walked in i was just blown away by the lighting, flowers, wood and iron work, a reservationist, and a full bar.
Decor is simple yet functional and although the staff are not the most attentive in the world, you don't feel rushed and the food is good, hot with decent portion sizes and a good selection to suit most tastes.
This place is decent if you want to hang out with friends (who don't mind paying up) in a low-key atmosphere with good food, but don't mind putting up with sub-par level of service.
we had to wait at the bar for a table, but the atmosphere is bustling and is well worth it.
I KEPT WAITING FOR THE FLAVORS IN THIS RICH LOOKING SAUCE TO TAKE OVER, BUT THEY DID NOT, THE SCALLOP WAS A LITTLE RUBBERY.
true I had to wait longer for my table, but the ambience and the food definitely made up for it.
They have Boylan's root beer, coffee that's freshly ground that day, and a relaxed casual atmosphere with friendly waitresses.
The fresh sliced mozzerella, the sweet roasted peppers, the hint of garlic and oil, are just some of the ingredients that produce the light otherworldly tasty pizza at Grimaldi's.
Decor is sort of homey, with mismatched tables and plates.
For example, the flavor in each dish didn't really stand out and the spanish rice seemed more like uncle ben's with peas and corn mixed in.
If you're dining solo, you will feel completely at ease in the cozy environs; in fact, you're likely to see at least one other solo diner hunched over a book, sipping a glass of Chianti.
Intrigued by the ambience of the restaurant, some friends and I decided to have dinner at Paladar on Saturday night.
Patrons are a mix of pre-theater and local regulars whose relaxed laughter and gesturing conversations add much to the restaurant's flavor.
While the staff was kind and attentive, our waiter never once broke a smile, even when I told him it was my friend's birthday, although he did bring a dessert with a candle at the end of the meal.
I really like the decor and it made it feel like I was having drinks at a mansion.
The atmosphere is certainly unlike any other restaurant in all of Manhattan, but it is a pity that the food does not live up to the decor.
The music is a mix of house radio as well as live band at the same time.
Comfort is decidedly not a factor in the Arturo's experience--once patrons escape the bottleneck near the bar, they're shoehorned into a miniscule dining room.
For a normal dinner, I prefer a place that has a bit more room and that has a slightly more relaxed vibe.
The ambience is horrible but the food is incredible.
Nostalgic lodgey bric-a-brac adorns the livelier front dining room and bar, while the dim, non-smoking back room is decorated with stained glass and modern, Mission-style chairs.
The atmosphere was nice in the front room, but despite a reservation, we were relegated to the rear, where we were treated like stepchildren - we had to flag someone down to take our order, water with no ice, we had to ask for extras (as opposed to someone asking if we needed something else).
While the food was good enough (if old-fashioned - my meal tasted like it was out of a fancy 1950s cookbook, all creamy and rich) the environment was sort of bizarre - rich tapestries, yucky corner-grocer roses on the tables, and a strange '80s mirrored wall, which we sat against at the back of the restaurant.
i think that the second floor is better if you prefer a quieter environment for dinner.
But, quickly all would realize that most items on the menu are grease-laden, and the portions are so big that you'd get tired of the flavors before you finish half a plate.
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
There was live music at the bar, which made our wait for a table wonderful (we didn't have reservations).
A few years ago I would have rated it much higher, but now - with other better choices such as Candle Cafe, Good Health Cafe and others, the dated menu, crowded atmosphere are spacey service is not the greatest choice.
The Setting The exposed brick and tangerine walls, flickering candles and tiny bar cast a formal mood across this cozy Park Slope trattoria, but the high ceiling fans and two glass walls (left open in warm weather) add a casual breeziness.
great food, even better price, they also have a dj spinning great music, definitely a must try.
A very pretty setting to have a meal, but unfortunately the service and food don't match the atmosphere.
The caesar salad was a huge bowl of iceberg lettuce, a dressing that wasn't ceasar, 1 crouton and a few slices of thin chicken -- for $12.
The service isn't spectacular and neither is the ambience, but on a lunch hour, all you're looking for is a satisfied stomach.
Great decor, expensive drinks but worth the price, but the music is bland and the crowd is very cheezy.
Great place to get a good fulfilling meal but do not go for ambience or service.
The food and decor is above average, but it is clear the restaurant has bad management and service.
The Japanese folk music blaring on the quaint speakers are a trip and they have some interesting things on the menu like bull pen|s and turkey testicles.
Subtle decor, above average wine list and a menu with a difference.
Art and miscellany adorn the black-painted walls; strings of colored lights, disco balls and TVs are hung here and there; and on weekends a DJ fills the dining room with loud dance beats.
Had a few appetizers; smoked duck was served cold but good flavor, tofu was good/fresh too, nothing to rave about though.
Even at lunch, when lawyers and publishers flock in to wheel and deal over the justly-popular lunch buffet, the atmosphere remains serene.
Had a late-night dinner there on Friday, and while the decor is fabulous, we waited a long time for our check.
the decor isn't quite like Shun Lee but the service will definitely make up for any shortcoming.
To enhance the dining experience, there is a live jazz band, which further isolates you from the world outside the gates.
Although we were seated quickly, ambiance was cozy, service was decent the overall menu selection and overall food taste and presentation was less to be desired!
The Food Mafrici's approach to modern Italian fare may seem gimmicky: The menu lists eight seasonal ingredients, each prepared as an appetizer, pasta and entree.
A friend and I went for dinner, the host was rude to us as we walked in, we stayed because the decor is charming and we wanted french food.
Not the best ambiance, but meat that'll make you drool.
Also lovely was the atmosphere; the high ceilings and spacious room make it a nice contrast from the other brunch mills on the upper west side.
Clams, shrimp, mussels, scungilli, and calamari served together in a spicy red sauce atop linguine are full of flavor; steak pizzaiola, a heroic portion of tender beef in a pool of garlicky marinara, comes with a side of spaghetti.
We did enjoy the recommended, yet simple $40 sangiovese, atmosphere and loosey-goosey service, but we were disappointed overall.
sashimi was meh, salmon was good but the tuna was a little white and seemed like the day before as the flavor had faded.
What the sparse space lacks in decor it makes up for in atmosphere.
Because our daughters weren't sure what to order, and were a little intimidated at the surroundings (notwithstanding the beautiful simplicity of the decor), they ordered only appetizers while their fathers ordered dinner.
this has become one of my favorite spots to hang out at the bar and drink martinis, not only because the atmosphere is energetic and lively, but also becasue the staff are so friendly.
Ignoring the plain decor, Jo-An is one of the best options for cheap japanese food on the Upper West Side.
Same quality for 1/3 the price and a realistic atmosphere.
The decor was pleasant, but the tables were way too much crowded for a restaurant of this presumptive caliber.
Tension filled the air as the chief yelled at a waiter in the middle of the bar while in uniform and drinking.
then the manager gave us lemon juice instead of ceasar dressing for a ceasar salad which ruined the salad.
Food is fine but unremarkable, atmosphere is very noisy, especially for a date, and our waiter looked like he had never seen us before when we reminded him that we had ordered a second round of drinks 20 minutes earlier.
Ones experience is truly dampened by having to trundle up lifts and escalators, further on arrival at the restaurant we found the actual dining room to be slightly sterile and lacking in atmosphere.
This is the perfect place to come with a group from work, people from out of town, or just to have a drink at the bar and enjoy the atmosphere.
Went here with my husband on a Saturday night for dinner since the place looked like it had great atmosphere.
Highly suggest you sit at the bar for added atmosphere and generally friendly people.
- , the desserts are sinful, the moroccan hospitality evident in the wait staff's friendliness and there is an overall ambience that makes you want to stay all night!
The service and atmosphere may not set your mood but when you're done you will realize that it's only the food that counts!
atmosphere is not that relaxing, if you go - you MUST bring a cell phone and go down the street for a drink.
I felt that the meat had little flavor(ribs and chicken) and as result I had to use A ALOT of their bbq sauce (which is good) and the ribs were not falling of the bone.
The decor in the dinin room is a bit bland, but the service is always friendly.
Don't let the decor fool you because you will miss out in some of the best food you ever eaten.
We actually enjoy eating there earlier for lunch definatly a more relaxed atmosphere.
Interesting crowd for people watching - old school Italian music cranking - friendly Italian waitress brought us our wine garlic bread in no time.
The place is full of flavor and color and the music just puts you in the mood for food and drinks.
I loved the food and service here, the only downside was the decor was dissappointing and the prices are a bit high (about $30 for an entree.
we had dinner at becco on a friday night, and were seated in the left bar area, which while pretty crowded, had a manageable noise level.
Don't go if you want a serene environment to go with your sushi.
It's in a less travelled spot on 3rd, but the intimate setting is great and romantic.
the place has an awesome decore, with fish swiming below certain tables.
The atmosphere couldn't be better, and the service was outstanding -- at the time there were only two people working the entire bar, and we still got taken care of like it was a five star restaurant.
Music is a nice mix of everything from Aerosmith to James Brown to Metallica to disco to whatever else there is.
If you want peace quiet, ambience and patient service, go elsewhere.
The atmosphere is perfect, whether sitting down for dinner or just having a drink at the bar and engaging the friendly bartenders in converasation.
This is the kind of place that is suppose to have pushy waiters and a loud atmosphere.
Nice decor poor food poor service.
Atmosphere, I'd give to Rosa or Maya, but Mexican fare at Zarela is tops.
The atmosphere's a bit grungy, yes, but the music and the coffee are good.
If you want a quiet dinner don't show up late, cuz the atmosphere gets louder and more loungy as the nite goes on.
This past Memorial day weekend was hot and I asked the waiter why was the air condition not working and he responded doens't know why.
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the price paid, I expected it to have some type of flavor.
You may as well just extend the bar into the restaurant since it has already penetrated it with loud music, loud voices, and a remarkable amount of cigarette smoke.
The atmosphere is nice, food is really worth it, especially for such prices, but service sucks:  I first ordered 2 different martinis and never got the one I asked for;  they brought the wrong dishes -although it was quick!- and then we had to ask for chopsticks to be able to eat our dishes.
I tried several dishes, while at dinner with friends, and was amazed to discover that even their Caesar Salad was completely lacking in flavor.
Dominic will give you the ambience of the old times when they were all immigrants and good food was equivalent of good friends and unforgettable times.
The basil pepper mojito was a little daunting in concept, but I was refreshed at the flavor.
The atmosphere of the place is nice as well as the location, but I found food mediocre and too expensive for the quality offered.
Great pizza and heros, without the variety and selection of that star wars-style canteena hipster crowd pizzeria on Bedford (Anna Maria's) but with 5X the flavor.
Bouley has done an excellent job creating this dining establishment with almost a museum sense, the artworks on the wall have a very Klimty feeling and the gold ceiling completes the rest of the experience.
Very pleasant atmosphere, not a quiet romantic dinner.
The veal was nice and tender, but the flavors weren't exciting.
Noise level is high, and if you are a non smoker ask to be seated away from the bar.
The attention to detail whether it's decor or service or menu made us feel fortunate to be part of the Camino Sur dining experience.
The environment is a touch loud (although the music's good), but the walls sport nifty vintage items, from license plates to pennants to movie posters.
Our waiter was a real pro; knew a lot about ingredients and allowed us to take our time.
The two cons were the lack of information on the menus (they had just sushi roll names, with no description of their contents, printed in a bland format), and music selection, which didn't fit the ambiance.
i thought the food was great but kind of expensive for that atmosphere, the tables were too close and it was too noisy.
I went here for a dinner with some relatives from out of town that I was eager to catch up with, but the noise level at this place made that really difficult!
The service was good and the price was decent but it wasn't enough to overcome the bland tasting food and the bland decor of the restaurant.
Taci then moved to NYU, to a space as warm as an igloo, with an equally cold atmosphere, an attempt at a more upscale menu, and with all the charm of a pizza joint.
and although the service is a little slow, the lax atmosphere allows you to drink and eat away the afternoon or evening and not even care.
We sat in the garden out back, and the calm atmosphere with the waterfall rock wall on the side completed the setting.
While the environment is still fun and diverse, the food quality has been sliding lately.
Good atmosphere, the service is so-so and there is a long wait if you don't have reservations.
We sat, missing a place setting for a while before the waitress came to ask if we wanted water and then ran away.
I would say it's suitable for a romantic date or quiet family meal, as there is no bar so the atmosphere is a little quiet.
The restauarnt is Ok in terms of decor, but the food was really lacking - things were not cooked to order.
Not the most beautiful environment, but the food is consistently delicious and the barbeque is fun and tasty.
The entertainment is awesome - and believe it or not, I was so impressed with one of their musicians/singers (named Alessandro) that I even had him play during my cocktail hour.
Dim, candlelit dining room is accented by a funky star pointed bar and multi-colored ceiling lamps, with trendy upbeat music in the background.
The decor isn't the best and the place is very modest, but if you're around Ditmars Blvd.
The only apparent flavor in any of the dishes was heat, and a table of four gourmands left at least half of our meals on our plates.
When we asked if the waiter could put the lights back on, he said:we have this complaint every night but the owner thinks it's more 'Parisian'!
Not the best ambience and the service is sometimes just mediocre, but the quality of the food is incredible.
The Scene The consistent lines at this bustling Japanese tapas hot spot don't lie: Yokocho's fresh, reasonably priced comfort food and social atmosphere draw a youthful clientele of cultural natives and gaijin alike.
The Food There's no need to slump into a well-known comfort zone of teriyaki and udon.
The outdoor patio is really nice in good weather, but what ambience the indoors possesses is negated by the noise and the crowds.
Overall, I would rather go to a chain coffee house up the street for the same priced coffee, but a much more relaxing atmosphere, and no one forgetting my order.
Don't expect trendy atmosphere: room looks like it could have been designed in 1940s, but who cares - it's actually comfortable and inviting; with great food and unbeatable value, you can't go wrong.
The pizza is baked in a wood burning oven and the flavor is fantastic.
From the overstuffed menu to the placemats advertising spectacularly festive drinks, to the comfy booths, the decor signals -- this is indeed your grandfather's diner and thank goodness for it.
The Scene Cooing couples find some formality and open air up in the front room, while the subterranean back area offers hunkered-down seating for loungier dining.
At least you have the ambiance and lovely live piano musice being played for you while you wait.
same atmosphere but food was better before years ago- octopus was like chewing a rubber tire- dumplings tasted artificial.
The atmosphere was so fun that we decided to have another cocktail at the bar and enjoy the scene.
Forget about the staff and go for the food and pleasant, if a bit cramped Lancaster, Pennsylvania like decor for comfort.
The food is just ok, not really memorable and not what you expect for the price but I guess the atmosphere is what you pay for.
I'm totally into the space-age vibe of this place, but I wish they had more tables to sit down at.
We waited at the bar for only 10 minutes (we had a reservation) - can't complain about that, the restaurant was full and I enjoyed the lively atmosphere and music.
The decor is not special at all but their food and amazing prices make up for it.
Granted we were just the girls, but this would also be a great date spot b/c the ambiance is chic and bustling yet you can also hear the conversation at your own table rather than a loud din or worse, someone else's conversation.
In the front bar, boisterous neighbors and friends share bottles of wine; the large dining room, with its lovely painted ceiling and oversized portrait of a portly chef, is the destination for serious eating.
Comfort standbys--including bacon-wrapped meat loaf and barbecued ribs, and upscaled interpretations--like tuna club made with wasabi mayo, share space with brunch favorites (Belgian waffles, fluffy buttermilk pancakes and wrecked eggs, or tofu).
I ordered dessert and it was they gave me the wrong flavor of ice cream.
The Scene You won't blink twice at the restaurant's spartan decor: As the packed crowds and critics' praises wallpapering the front wall agree, this longtime local favorite is truly one of the area's most exquisite finds.
At least the entertainment was free, as we were able to witness one customer wooing a waitress, and another being drenched in milk.
I can't even remember if they serve anything else -- a busy hole in the wall sized place and atmosphere.
While I would agree with the initial review that Asia de Cuba isn't really Asian or Cuban in its decor, the food was a nice fusion.
Meat wasn't fall-off-the bone (a sign of over-cooking) but was tender and had deep flavor.
I thought the bar was fair in terms of decor, but how long do you have wait at the bar before a bartender with an attitude (he wasn't rude, but not friendly) makes you an awful drink, but food was delightful and music light and tasty as well.
maybe its the cost of top ingredients but 17.
The restaurant has a somewhat unique decor, with portrait of the owner meditating and books about meditation.
The Crystal Ballroom was closed for a private party, so we couldn't even enjoy the decor.
The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.
In addition, they lack basic ammenities like a toaster, and the decor was shabby, at best.
The ambience is extremely romantic, even if you get seated upstairs.
It still took a little while to get our drinks and food - But the atmosphere made up for it.
The service was not great, the wait staff were not clear on the ingredients and or preparation details of the meals.
If you don't mind eating great thai food in a schnazzy ambience with a hop hip lunch crowd, then come on over to SPICE.
It's not going to win any awards for its decor, but the food is good, the portions are big, and the prices are low.
the atmosphere is that of a diner, but if you get a booth that is the best!
Basically the comfort is lacking but the food is the focus.
The bar area got a little too crowded but the ambiance was great.
There is a long bar area wide enough to accommodate large crowds, large screen tv's on the walls to view games, but not that do not dominate the atmosphere, and up front there is a large lounge are with several booths and a working fireplace.
I absolutely hate communal seating and closely spaced tables and this place had both, but the atmosphere and the food were such that I was able to get beyond the grumpy mood that put me in to have a really good experience.
They need to change the overall decor if they want to get a serious dinner crowd though.
The atmosphere is still to die for, but the wine list has so clearly been pared down and marked up (as a result of higher foot traffic brought in by lots of rave reviews in local publications, perhaps?
Not only is it the nicest atmosphere with an antique bar and allabaster globes sconces, marble fireplace.
The Scene Honeycomb-colored walls, random wall art, a peek into the kitchen from paper-topped tables--all combine for a casual, thrown-together ambience.
The music is a little bit louder, but the food is excellent.
It's sad that everything about this place was great (even the service and decor) except for the steak.
the sushi is so-so, the 70s orange-themed atmosphere is 2000ish, and there is no reason for the staff's attitude.
The mole sauce is not too sweet and adds a nice flavor to the otherwise bland chicken.
went here w/ great expectations and was greatly disappointed; the food was good, not great and vastly overpriced- one salad, two pasta dishes, two demi-carafes of red wine- $100 (tax and tip); rediculous; orechiette came w/ so little brocoli rape that it did not have its characteristic flavor; and it is very very loud.
Two Tom's food is excellent, it more than makes up for the lack of decor.
Yes, this place is good, a cut above some of the other local diner food and a nice, friendly atmosphere.
Nice ambience and bar while waiting for a table.
Overall, the food makes up for what is missing in the ambience and service.
However the casual atmosphere comes in handy if you want a good place to drop in and get food.
Desserts were visually inventive but lacking in flavor.
Unfortunately the food and the service don't live up to the spectacular setting.
I liked the overall setting A LOT and it was only improved by the fact that our waiter was pleasant and attentive even though we only ordered entrees (no drinks, no appetizers, no coffee).
It is a nice diner atmosphere, they have booths all around and a couple of middle tables.
Overall,it's a good place to have dinner and hang out if you do not mind waiting for food,weird music and rude manager.
The strong suit of this place is the decor, alas we was seated and served by some guy who looked like he was out of a seedy 70's porn movie and everything went downhill after.
They did a great job on the decor but it seems that the food has gotten a bit less in the quality department, as well as in the portion size!
The ambience is cool, and the cocktails might be worth coming by, but head somewhere else for dinner.
Dishes feature intriguing names, and interesting combinations of fresh ingredients.
What it lacks in decor it more than makes up in the cuisine.
you go all out with dress, tastes, and performance, and in the end its really about having a good time where you truly indulge yoursef in good vodka, compnay, music, and food.
In Short It's a bakery, takeout place and cafe all in one, and thanks to dishes prepared using the same ingredients stocked at famed gourmet food emporium, Zabar's, prices and quality are upscale.
The decor was mediocre and honestly, I can get a better brunch at a Cracker Barrel restaurant.
(try the Queso Fundido and fire) Upstairs there is a dining room which is decorated with brightly colored mexican theme.
The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad.
The store has a great atmosphere amd amazing staff who are always there to help if its a cup of coffee or a nice chat.
The only drawback was slow service, but the food and ambience are so nice that your wait is A) pleasant and B) worth it.
I went on a saturday and the atmosphere was no more exciting than eating dinner at home.
the place had open doors and windows and a very relaxed, candle-lit type of atmosphere.
If you're not looking for a pretentious atmosphere and a restaurant that serves the best steak you've ever eaten.
Upon entering Alta the bar and restaurant decor ironically misguide the patron.
The ingredients used are of a good quality and the taste is superb.
In Short Many Murray Hill locals gladly overlook the dull green walls and fluorescent lighting for Jaiya's quick and affordable Thai cooking--if not, they take meals to go or get them delivered.
The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.
Although I usually go out mid-week for lunch, I now make it a habit to stop out Thursday or Friday evening to enjoy the live Jazz band.
Too bad the food and service aren't nearly as nice as the decor.
The ambience was all wrong, the bar opened into the main dining room causing the noise to flow into the room.
Each dish is carefully prepared and is a tribute to the ingredients being served.
Let me count the problems: music so loud it hurt, sticky unclean tables, the waitress took a long time to take our order, and then didn't bring a glass for the beer.
Music was blasting (speakers located practically on top of every table), and we asked the waitress if they can turn it down.
Patrons can choose to be seated in the front room with a little more activity and more of a bar feel or in one of the 2 back rooms which both offer slightly quieter, more relaxed environments.
the best thing is the atmosphere, but even that is overshadowed by the lack of taste and originality in the food.
I like how the ambiance changes from the cafeteria style of lunch to a sit down dinner in romantic lighting.
I would say that the atmosphere was nothing amazing, I didn't feel like the authenticity of the history of the place was nearly as prevelant as it could have been in the experience.
An unpretentious sexy atmosphere lends itself to the above average wine-list and a menu that can stand-up to any other restaurant in NewYork City (or Paris).
The decor there is nothing special, though somehow the service manages to deal with the large crowds in an efficient, friendly manner.
Get some drinks and listen to the free live music.
Our waiter didn't know the menu or the ingredients.
The ambience is diner-like and the wait staff is rushed, but at these prices, I can't complain.
If it's atmosphere you want go to the River Cafe under the bridges and pay an arm and a leg for hospital-type food.
I lived next door and loved to go down for a drink at their uplit marble bar under the beautiful lighting or sit by the fireplace when the live band is not playing.
Most of the food has a vinegary flavor (I think because of the injera).
While the design of the space and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable (with a great view of Union Square), the food has once again proved to be less than favorable and the service mediocre.
I think they just tried to get a little too creative with the menu and actually ended up losing flavor in some of the dishes.
They were playing top 40 music the day I went which just didn't work with the whole theme, but they had the trippy sci-fi music playing in the bathroom, so it was almost right.
Come-as-you-are atmosphere, jukebox, value and James behind the bar work as a magnet.
Management had always been rude, but without the great staff as a buffer, Jesse's is just another pubby place with poor decor and average food.
Having just returned from Bourbon Street, I thought I had experienced the steepest drink prices in the US, but this is worse than N'awlins, where at least the expensive drinks cover wonderful live music.
The atmosphere is bland and non-descript and the service is fine.
The atmosphere is fun -- dark, pulsing, basement room; a place where you feel like you can relax.
The Scene There are two distinct personalities to the place: The loud, seemingly always-crowded bar with hanging paper decorations and dim lighting, and the two main dining areas, where the noise level and decor is notably more subdued.
Although the decor is lovely as usual, service has detiorated.
But it's the ambience that is the draw for me---sipping red wine and sitting under the red awning on a warm night.
They may love the wacky/tacky decore, the overly gracious host, Gus, and his staff, the loads of freebies (oranges, cookies, lollies and wet naps), but the food is just mediocre.
In the dim lighting, I thought the portions were impressive and dug in.
Decor is old, but the bathrooms are clean and updated.
Atmosphere in the formal room was nice, but the informal dining room was extremely loud which ultimately made the formal room louder than my perference.
The place was small and simple, but I never cared about service or decor.
Additionally the bar upstairs is picturesque and spacious, even though the techno music is horrible.
on the food-front while adding just enough of a civilized atmosphere where you won't worry about either your neighbor or the wait staff biting off one of your fingers.
I love the decor but would not recommend sitting in the communal tables unless its a very big group, much more fun getting a table and people watch while you chomp on your $20 palm sized truffle pizza.
It's too loud and the cheesiest music is played throughout the meal.
The pro's: Good ambience,service The Con's: For the 4 to 5 star price (200 dollars for 2 people which included 2 drinks each, an appetizer, main course, and a hsared dessert), the food and presentation was just average.
I've been here twice for brunch, and I found the ambience and food to be much better than the overly-hyped Kitchenette next door.
The food was good, the service was fine, and the place has a lot of visual atmosphere, but I would not go back unless I was stuck eating with someone I didn't want to listen to.
Nice decor - but the place is so crowded and noisy you can't enjoy it.
Aside from the service being slow, the place was packed w/ a good crowd and music was amazing.
I mean no disrespect to the owner, just constructive criticism - improve the decor and dine-in service, but DON'T change the portions or the recipes.
Recommended to those who want to try a different setting for a diner.
it is too bad because the food, ambiance, and drinks were great but they need serious help on the service.
Come in the evening, sip a glass of wine, or two, and enjoy the great live jazz along with your dinner.
Don't go for the decor or the location, go for the food!
We waited forever for our orders, our drinks came out AFTER our food, we never got refills on water, we had to ask like three times for extra dressing, and our waiter was rude.
The Scene Behind the often-fogged windows at this small restaurant is a homey atmosphere, full of smiling employees and Filipino families crowded around simple red tables.
I definitely liked the vibe in the restaurant - the food is good with enough variety to please everyone - i'd say the portions were quite skimpy where it counts - meat whether fish or steak- and for those prices this is very irksome.
Start by enjoying the atmosphere while having a glass of wine at the bar and we you are ready, go and enjoy your food!
The place is a little over-priced for brunch but it is a nice restaurant so that was expected Food (i had the omelette with cheddar, mushrooms and herbs), service, coffee, atmosphere were all fantastic.
Super friendly neighboorhood atmosphere where even a lady can go alone and have a drink and feel comfortable.
SQC is great in the evening, the light is excellent and it's perfect to sit at the bar, eat oysters on the half shell and have a glass of wine.
Although the atmosphere was lacking, I could definitely recommend a trip to Esca for the fish alone!
The Scene North Square's discreet, sedate decor appeals to the largley older crowd occupying the dining room whilst a younger set parties in the back bar.
Great roofdeck, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet.
About 10 of us came here for drinks last friday, the atmosphere was good for chatting and hanging out, but not enough lounge or bar space, they should open up the back area w/ more loungable chairs or booths if they want to catch any after dinner sort of bar crowd.
The freshness of the ingredients down to the perfection of the crust, it is truly the best.
The atmosphere was fun and if you sit by the window, there is a lot of people-watching to be had!
At dinner on a Saturday night, I was enthused by the bustling, unpretentious crowd and the lusciously warm lighting.
And the ambience is very cool, stop by on a Saturday afternoon and you can play some old school games while having a beer.
Superfine is my preferred destination in the city when I'm looking for a casual, hip atmosphere, extraordinary food at decent prices and/or just a place to get a good drink, chat with the bartender and shoot some (free) pool.
I left feeling unsatisfied, except for having a nice chance to people watch in the cozy atmosphere with my over-priced pasta bolognese.
The food is average, however the service is way below average (our waiter was a stuttering fool when it came to the specials and left our drinks empty for the majority of the night) The atmostphere is cheesy as well as the crowd.
Nice family place, nice atmosphere, but don't go there for pizza.
I don't have much to say about the cafe itself; you can order out from the family-run cafe in the front, or take a seat in the back, which opens up to the outdoors and can offer a less seedy and more homey atmosphere.
From making the reservation (not required) to the before dinner drink (cava), to the table (romantic), to the the ambiance (candles, spanish antiques, etc) to the food of course (original, incredibly deep and rich in flavor) to our departure and saying goodnight to the waiter.
The noise level is equivalent to a sports bar.
The crust was a crispy tan dream come true with those little blackened air bubbles and chewy center.
The service is excellent and always informative without an air.
I had to wait 1hr since I got there around 8pm but you could have a few drinks by the bar since the ambiance is very loungy/ club like.
The atmosphere was embracing and enticing and the costs of the meal, $45 to $55 in value.
Once dinner ended the party really started going inside they were playing great music.
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.
The Scene This storefront eatery is decked with colorful Mexican art and party kitsch, but it gets dim and moody enough in the evenings to suit a date.
Zero decor, this is not a date place--just a great place to get a quick, tasty and cheap meal.
The place has a sort of trendy pseudo-asian decor that seems perfectly casual or romantic.
The Food Chef-owner Tom Valenti's food makes just as much noise; he cooks in a masculine, big-flavored, meat-and-potatoes style, rich with terrines, mustards, eggs and bitter greens.
Don't let the ambiance of this place fool you, the food is far better than many pricey establishments.
Noisy atmosphere makes the place even more fun, though it may become hard to get in after 5PM on Friday- almost every table would be reserved.
My friends and I had a great time - the atmosphere was exciting but didn't encroach on us while we had our meal and drinks (which is better, the kiwitini or the watermelon martini?)
The ambiance and service is great but I wish I could say the same about the food.
The menu is informatively presented with facts about the ingredients, and is divided into Starting and Sharing plates, which allows one to sample a few items during the meal.
anyway, nice place for brunch for selection under $20 meals desserts were great (3 flavors for creme brulee!!
Fantastic flavor, but certainly not worth the high price of the small glass.
I ordered the flounder special - the fish was fresh but the dish lacked flavor.
ambience and decoration was nice but for a check of $330 for 5 for brunch and with just average food.
This place basically has the same menu as Penang but everything is cheaper, including the atmosphere.
Nothing too special about the location or the atmosphere, but DAMN, the pizza is good.
The waiters are sometimes grouchy and the decor doesn't change, but the food is always delicious and satisfying.
from the white sheets that hang when you come into the restaurant, to the gorgeous marble communal table in the center of the bottom floor, to the great atmosphere upstairs at the bar.
The ambience is simple, yet elegant and be sure to finish your meal with their famous shlog.
The decor is a little plain and the seating is a touch too close but its worth it for the food.
The atmosphere is nice - it's all dark wood with the bar in the front.
The food at Forest Hills was great, the service more than perfect, but but the ambience was too hot they do not have AC and the employes was sweating a lot , it was a nasty esxperience because I eat in front of the service that was sweating like animals.
There was a nice atmosphere except for the few pompous patrons who looked way too gaudy or a lunch time meal, but overall its a great place to eat.
The service was good, if a little slow, and the place was very crowded (which can be comforting, but on a date it may be hard with the constant noise).
Fun atmosphere, good beer selection, but meals were skimpy portions on big plates and the service was weak - never had the same server/waitperson come back twice.
Cute decor, but rather small so the dining room can get very smoky if the bar is crowded.
Even though the food was prepared nicely, it was definitely lacking flavor.
They draw you in with a fancy looking decore which obviously cost a mint, ply you with overpriced wines (one bottle I knew was a 6$and they had the nerve to charge 40) This place sufferes from the same problem Areos does, it rests on its reputation.
Basically, all the food on the menu is a half-ass'd attempt at vietnamese food, followed by a innappropriate heap of MSG to make up for the lack of any flavor.
Very cheesy wanna be romantic decor and entertainment, but have some vodka and you want to come right out onto the dance floor and dance the night away to a mix of really bad russian and american disco music.
after dinner we went downstairs atmosphere was completely different , nice crowd , we stayed there more time than expected.
Flavors range from standards to hard-to-find Italian options, like tiramisu, hazelnut and zuppa inglese.
The decor is worth a mention, with plush seating areas that range from bar stools to table/chair combos to full sofa areas.
Although the wait staff was friendly, the atmosphere was not.
The wine list is good, and overall it is not too expensive, though, and the atmosphere is very dark and brick-covered, much like any damp basement.
If she was a bit more sophisticated, she wouldn't have been impressed with the list, but rather with the clientele and atmosphere.
While the service and setting were average, the food was excellent.
The food is decent, average bistro food, the decor is nice, but the service is poor, the waiters always seems to have to many tables andcant keep up with a good services.
Besides the food, the ambience reminds one of being in your grannie's dining room.
Although the prices are kind of high for lunch the atmosphere is nice.
In the most beautiful ground floor brownstone setting.
The atmosphere could be considered amiable, if you possess roguish frat-boy nostalgia.
The food was simple but exploded with flavor and the presentation was as if it was out of a cook book.
The Sushi was of the highest caliber, the cut as if a master samurai marks smith was behind the bar, and service, just what you would expect from a fine dining establishment, New York style.
I will be back not only because the price was so unbelievable but the atmosphere was just plain COOL and the food was spectacular.
Appetizers and entrees were merely adequate, but you can't beat the pool room for atmosphere.
This place is so very nearly achieving, but in the mean time, my advice - eat early elsewhere, then take your seat, order a bottle of wine and enjoy the performance and the ambience.
It is now nothing but an overpriced establishment that is shamelessly riding on the coat tails of its past.
The atmosphere was wonderful, however the service and food were not.
The piano guy isn't there all the time, but when he is it's a great addition to the meal.
Oh, and kudos to the hostess who appeared out of thin air with extra napkins just moments after a glass of water was knocked over - she's upping the bar on service here.
The noise here is so bad that people entered and left without ordering and they lowered the lights during the dinner.
Sure, the burgers are good, but not good enough to make up for the abominable service and disgusting, filthy atmosphere.
I went here all 4 years that I lived in the area, and being a not-so-loaded student, it was a great place to go for some good sushi and a very pleasant comforting atmosphere.
Odd, traditional and clashing decor will only detract from your experience if the square box layout or perma-draft through the pane glass door doesn't get you first.
We went to the Sunday brunch, and were pleasantly surprised to find a jazz combo there.
I came to celebrate finishing my third year of med school and was greatly disappointed by the way I was treated at the door (rude and terse), the food (mediocre), and the ambiance (very loud, crowded, and uncomfortable close to our neighbors despite the large room).
the decor could be a bit better, and if there was a small bar the overall atmosphere would be a bit more inviting (especially for regulars).
You're not going there for the decor you're going there for the best freeking pizza on the face of this earth and I garuntee you Dom delivers big time!
Costs could be better - expect to be upsold by the hovering wait staff - and come for the authentic tastes, not the interior decor (looked a littel like Cheers!
True, the ambiance is something out of Goodfellas, but it the food and waiters are out of this world!
It took us about 30 minutes to get seated, the burgers came without lettuce, they brougt us the wrong drinks, and the flavor of the burgers were below average.
great decor, unfortunately the worst service possible.
The Scene This vintage Cuban diner, with white acrylic tables, soft Spanish music humming pleasantly in the background and regulars casually hugging the counter, serves some of the cheapest, tastiest fare in the area.
The decor has not quite made the transition--some really nice artifacts are still there, but there are several layers of different remodeling efforts visible.
Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.
The ambience is stunning and the food is really good, but the portions are RIDICULOUSLY small.
The decor is nothing great to speak of, but who cares - the food is top notch.
As the night rolls on the place turns into a bar/lounge so the wait staff is constantly rushing you to eat up and move out, not the kind of atmosphere you want for the price you are paying for your entree.
who seemed honestly offended that we asked why our table was 45 minutes late; a cold cafeteria room that was clearly designed to intimidate; and haute chinese food that was over-salted to make up for the lack of flavor.
The atmosphere is warmly dim and inviting - if you make a reservation, ask for a corner both for extra coziness!
I must admit that when my friend said we were going to Astoria for dinner, I expected a diner sytle restaurant, where the decor, food and service would not suffice.
The red sauce had no flavor, the cheese lacked that fresh quality cheese taste you expect from a well-known pizzaria, and the slice overall was really dry.
The overpriced food that's supposed to come off as homestyle diner just doesn't work when the atmosphere is supposed to be super cool but the food is super bland.
As a chef I really appreciated the well executed dishes that were full of crisp and vibrant flavor contrast acting in harmony and perfect balance.
The ambience isn't great but the food is so tasty and so reasonably priced that it's definitely a fun date place if you want to get a bunch of stuff and sample.
Despite a lovely atmosphere, this was perhaps the worst dining experience I've had in New York.
The decor and the service definitely is not the greatest, but I can overlook those things since their food is just so damn good.
the trendy atmosphere and high price fooled me into thinking that somehow the food would be innovative.
It might be the best sit down food I've had in the area, so if you are going to the upright citizen brigade, or the garden, it could be just the place for you.
I like the smaller portion size for dinner.
The bill was surprisingly inexpensive considering we each had appetizers, an entree, dessert and drinks (alcoholic and non) we also had 3 rounds of shots for the entire table.
) other food is served in too-small portions, but at least it leaves room for dessert.
After ordering drinks, we both decided on the Paella Vallenciana, brought out on hot plates.
Portions are fairly generous and the staff brings out multiple little bites and treats throughout dinner.
I had to ask for bread for the table (several times).
Specialty drinks--alcoholic and non--arrive in skull mugs or mini-canteens, nifty take-home souvenirs.
Towards the end of our meal, a server came out, apparently our orders had been double-filled.
Upon entering, I was impressed by the room while the food on other peoples' tables seemed enticing.
The beginning of the meal wasnt bad, the hostess was very nice, we got our drinks about every 10 minutes and the appetizers we good.
I found that the food variety was great, and the waitress was very accommodating to my vegan boyfriend describing all items' ingredients and how you may request more of what YOU like, creating a unique experience.
Came recommended to us, but we found the food to be so-so, the service good, but we were told we could not order desert since the table we were at had a reservation waiting.
Our waitress couldn't tell us what was in the seafood special, forgot to put in our oyster order so it came at the same time as the main meals, wasn't able to provide a confident recommendation from the menu, and had to be flagged several times for drinks.
I went back (with my cold soups) They said they would have to make me another dish since they couldn't scrape off the unwanted ingredients.
And there wasn't much room for the people at the bar to stand either, as the restaurant attempted to squeeze as many tables into the restaurant as they could, forcing those dining to have to shift in their chairs every time a waiter attempted to get by.
Went for an early V-Day dinner, only to be highly disappointed by the service.
Before our food arrived I asked our waitress if we could be moved and she just stared blankly at me.
I still go often, but the prices went up a little and the service is even slower now that they're always full during dinner hours.
It is the only all Austrian wine list in the country and the waitress gladly broke it down for me, so I could find just the right wine for my meal.
its a cool place to come with a bunch of people or with a date for maybe a mild dinner or some drinks.
The final blow was when the waiter brought us the check before we had even finished dessert--never mind that the only reason we were taking a long time to finish the meal was because of the extreme delay in the service of our food.
worst margaritas in town,if you are going to order a battle of (white wine)they served hot.
They served the main course before the appetizers eventhough we asked for the latter first, to which our waiter responded that they don't serve them separately without telling us beforehand while ordering.
After requesting to be seated at an empty table, the waitress (who was so terribly burdened when we asked to move from the bar to the table to have dinner) asked us to get up from our seats and wait for a smaller table because a party of 3 just walked in.
Although the service can be a bit brusque at times, the food is always good, hearty and hot.
The Food Despite a menu that seems larger than the restaurant, great care goes into the preparation of every dish.
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC.
As if that wasnt enough, after another in the group mentioned that a portion of the sushi on her plate was not what she had ordered, the waiter came back with chopsticks and started to remove it (as she was eating!)
We started with the guacamole and this is by far the best I've ever had bar none.
If you eat here, just keep in mind that the specials are much higher than the regular menu when ordering.
The waiter was just throwing our dishes on the table without even clearing the appetizer plates and then they started clearing the food when we weren't even finished yet.
While service is still ok, the food has been not up to par on my last few visits.
After the wine experience, I actually expected worse than what was served.
Our server did not check on us, ask if we needed anything, refill our water or get our dessert order right.
The food at Cafe Asean is to die for, and the prices are unmatchable.
The Scene The entrance leads into a dim, narrow bar decorated with sake bottles, exposed brick and a beautiful arched wooden ceiling.
It also has great ice cream and spumoni ices.
However, the drinks are very good and this place is alright for brunch, if you don't mind sitting in a very cramped spot and/or waiting on line.
Sometimes, the take-out and seating lines can be long, but the staff help move things along.
The Food Regulars swear by the tamales, which are spongy, well-seasoned and pulled from steaming crocks on the counter.
Unfortunately, the food along with the unhelpful service doesn't make up for the atmosphere.
They expanded the seating with a cozy new back section, added some great new dishes (I had the most fantastic j erk Shrimp and exciting maize crusted salmon) but kept everything that was good (amazing staff and Mac Jack!)
Not to mention that the busboy spilled 2 glasses of water on my back and the Manager was NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
The waiter was miffed when we decided to order dessert (and I must say we were eating the courses as they arrived, no lingering).
Heck even if they had awful service and atmosphere I would still come to this place for their dumplings, luckly that is not the case.
The menu features classic French bistro fare, like steamed mussels with French fries and hangar steak with a green peppercorn sauce.
Had an after-work drink at the bar with a date, loved the place so much we came back for brunch the next morning.
The food was served promptly and was really hot.
The kitchen is open and surrounded by bar seating (the only kind of seating), and they have a nice set-up where the waitress stays behind the bar and the chefs deliver your food after you have watched them prepare it.
I had been to Blue Fin previously for drinks and appetizers and thought the atmosphere was very good (expecially for people watching).
The bar downstairs is a lot of fun, so if you get stuck waiting, just have drink.
We recently had brunch at this establishment with two other couples and I have to say I was majorly dissapointed with the service and how we were treated.
Although our waitress was pleasant and accomdating, the overpriced food was quite the opposite.
Their desserts were limited - I mean REALLY limited to 2 items (nothing like the online menu).
My group got charged an outrageuos $63/person for a family-style dinner, including a 23% tip added for the horrible service.
Bartenders look like model wannabes and threw out my friend's beer before he was finished (about 1/4 left).
The food at Parish was tasy and well-prepared, but the portions were absurdly miniscule, especially in proportion to the prices.
There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.
Yes, the wait is long and ridiculous as times, especially as you watch others gobble down their food.
considering the prices on the menu, i'd rather go somewhere else where they know how to refill water and real chairs for everyone, something you can even get at mcdonald's.
It was practically impossible to get the waitstaff's attention to order another bottle of wine.
After spending over $500 on a business dinner, a manager knelt down at our table and asked us to quote, wrap it up and move to the bar.
Recently I purchased a dish to go, and found that all of my meal contained just one large piece of ginger root.
The numbness in your lower legs from sitting on old wood chairs is more than compensated by the wonderful food.
Then, the waitress gave my wife coffee with regular milk in it even though my wife specifically requested Soy Milk.
The steak au poivre certainly lives up to its lofty reputation, but it shuoldn't overshadow many of the other delicacies on the menu, such as the crab cakes and the frisee salad.
Waiter was a strange bird and when told we wanted to enjoy our dining experience and not be rushed through dinner, he assured us it takes 30 minutes to get entrees once food was ordered.
This is not haute cuisine, but that' part of what I love about it - it has an honest, intimate feel with no pretensions, just like eating in an Italian family's home.
The food was so-so and you would think it was a french resturant, the portions were so tiny.
seems everyone ordered sushi there were tons of delivery orders (we can tell as we sat near the back).
small price to pay to have dinner on a Saturday night in downtown Manhattan.
The interior is understated making it special enough to take a date but easy enough to stop in anytime for dinner or snack.
The prices are incredibly reasonable, especially considering the HUGE portions - by noodle soup could have fed both my husband and myself.
The pizzas are a MUST TRY, hence the name.
The situation was verified by taking 3 dishes that were over an hour late off the bill and free desserts and coffee but the experience left most of us never wanting to go to the supposed hip cool 66 ever again.
I went there with family and even though we had reservations, we were seated 30 minutes late, the food took 45 minutes to arrive and when I got the wrong order, I had a hard time trying to find the server.
Though the menu is brief, entrees range from a deeply satisfying, wintry seared calf's liver with oven-dried tomatoes to a much lighter striped bass drizzled with textbook perfect beurre blanc.
When we got our food, the waitress barely said a word as she placed our take-out on the table and grabbed the check.
Dropped in for a quick bite with a friend -- like the previous reviewer it took more than 15 minutes for any kind of service at all (including getting water) and then another 45 minutes to get a burger (which admittedly was good).
The only complaint I have is that the tables for 2 along the booth are very close together so it wasn't as romantic a dinner as we wanted but all in all, we were in our own world, more like in heaven.
We complained to our waiter serveral times about this and the stares continued and to top it all off as the manager walked around to each table asking if they enjoyed their dinner, he conveniently did not ask us!
By dessert, I gave up and sat there hopelessly watching as my rice pudding was snatched away half eaten, only to be replaced immediately with a hefty bill.
) Scores of employees walking around, but no one seems to clear a plate or offer more drinks.
The manager also managed to insult one of my dining partners, even using an expletive to mock his last name when returning his credit card.
The waiter told us that he had checked with the kitchen because he noticed that we had not gotten our dinners and they said it would be out shortly, shouldn't someone have said something to us?
First of all, I think our service person was miffed that we couldn't order much for apps or drinks since we had already started at the bar.
You have to be comfortable eating with your hands, sharing the same plate with your friends and be able to handle spicy food (not as spicy as some thai dishes though).
however, we went for lunch and were the only ones eating there and yet the service seemed eager for us to be done and to get out.
Although the service was top notch, all of the food was disappointing: burnt octopus, bland ravioli, odd tasting mint love letters.
The portions were overly generous for both the apps and entrees without sacrificing the quality.
The menu is slightly different from downtown, but they still have my favorites -- madai salad with hot sesame oil, shrimp kanzuri, the diamond roll, the crispy shrimp roll.
SO I ASKED, TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER, AND ONE OF THE OWNER WHO MANAGES THE PLACE CAME TO MY TABLE, TOLD ME THAT THE CEVICHE WAS FRESH.
For example, we had ordered a 2nd bottle of red wine, the waitress gave me a new glass to taste the wine, but filled up my existing glass (mixing two different bottles in one glass).
As for the main attraction, the pies are known for their crisp outer edge and gooey middle, and feature the unorthodox layering of sauce over mozzarella.
I've never been during the dinner rush, whence I think most of the service complaints originate.
the atmosphere is trendy, i think it's better to come here for a drink rather than dinner.
Our dinner took over two hours because of the slow service.
Weekday lunch is less crowded and the staff cheerfully tolerated a 3-year-old.
Favorites include the Curry Shrimp w/ Mushrooms, Watercress Salad (not listed on menu), and Kao Soy noodle soup with chicken.
The food and service was top notch, only the complain is that this place is so small that some seats are not made for a big guy.
No bar only a waiting area with about 10 tables where you can have drinks prior to dinner.
The pieces were small but the fish was good quality and there wasn't a lot of rice to mess with.
although the food was good, the wait was so long; extremely snobby about seating you, we waited 45 min + for our reservation.
It's so out there that it works--black-clad raver waiters and all--and even the most normal of groups love getting together for dinner and popular brunching on the palm-lined backyard patio spread.
The waitress came to our table and told us about their tempting specials.
We asked the server for two glasses with a splash of Southern Comfort and Grand Marnier.
throughout the whole meal, all I kept thinking was AVERAGE, AVERAGE, AVERAGE until the bill came, which was a little more than average,to say the least.
The food is right out of heaven, arrive hungry because the portions are huge but not the prices.
Service is one thing but a restaurant like Craft needs to have much better quality food for the price they charge.
The service was polite, friendly and prompt, the characters walking around entertained the kids but werent intrusive to our meal.
If you've been out partying and have a yen for quality Korean food at 3:00am, there's a table waiting for you at Kang Suh Restaurant.
And that is a shame as the restaurant is a pizzeria with a very limited menu outside of pizza.
The waiter just slapped my food down and then never returned until he slapped my check down.
The bartenders could have been a lot nicer but the drinks they shook up kind of made up for their poor attitude.
Hillarious lighting and ecclectic side dishes make you want to love the place, but the meal on the whole was abyssmal.
The Food The menu ably pulls off Bistro 101: The generous cheese plate makes a big enough starter for at least three people to share, and French onion soup is rich and decadent.
However for the price I paid to have dinner there, you would have thought I ate a horse.
All this Asian fusion craze leaves one feeling like they should've went to an authentic Thai or Indian restaurant for probably 1/3 of the price of Spice Market.
I went with a friend from out the town - the best thing on the menu was the Veal.
The waitstaff is helpful and they'll get your favorite meats to circle your table more often if you just ask.
One server came and gave us food that turned out to be someone else's.
The food is not large and I could have had a few slices of pizza after I left.
Our experience consistently reflected a lazy attitude by the house towards cooking technique and customer care.
It appeared that they used a cheese pizza cooked earlier that day or the day before and just added the raw topping to it, then delivered it.
The wine did not come until we were half way through our entree and the waitress overcharged us by a bottle of wine.
service is good although a bit in your face, we were asked every five mins if food was ok, but better that than being ignored.
Enjoy the food, because it is remarkable, but don't be too willing to be gratuitis to a server that does not deserve it.
The waiter placed the wrong entree in front of us each time.
Gia Lam I' s service is not much better but the food was.
Forget the phony yuppies of Areos and The Pearl Room, and ENJOY the down home service and OUTSTANDING food here.
The wait was long which is understandable but the waiters were rude to us while we waited, rushed us to order, ignored us while we ate and needed more drinks, and rushed us when they wanted the table for another couple.
The Chinese menu is gone, along with most of the good dishes.
the waiter was unable to identify whether certain cheeses from the cheese course were cow or goat milk.
Ziti Bolognese is baked in a similar sauce, with ground meat mixed in and cheese melted on top--the menu offers many variations on this theme.
I just got back from dinner from this UES hotspot - it is like a home away from home - delicious meals and a salad dressing that sometimes they let me have a tiny container of for my lunch at work salads - the price/ atmosphere/ cocktails (FULL BAR!!!
Food was served very promptly, but our wait for drinks was surprisingly long.
While waiting there was no room for standing and the bar staff and their drinks were horrendous.
The word chicken was barely out of my mouth when the waiter rushed away from my table without asking me about side orders or a drink.
The scene is pretty cool and the drinks are OK, but the food and service were pretty weak.
Del Frisco's is pricey and I was seated in a leper locker room area, but the food was totally fantastic.
The waitress was no where to be found at all throughout the course of the meal, did not refill a single drink nor did she bother to inquire about my satisfaction with the food or even bring the check at the conclusion of the meal.
The waiter was rude to my friend when she asked for a small plate to share an appetizer.
The service was slow (10 minutes for drinks??)
Our waiter, though he was charming,was too busy to truly take care of us properly and the food was over priced.
The staff forgot my girlfriend's food altogether as she waited for half an hour.
We decided to get out of there and go to a safe place with bigger portions and normal food.
One oversight: the gf wanted tea to go along with the plate of yummies they gave me, but the server forgot to bring it since we took our time to finish the wine.
I have tried everything available on the AYCE menu, it has all been quite good (although I am not one to be especially particular with food, sushi in particular.
The service is not very good, but I find that we try Atlantic Grill at least once a year.
straining to read the menu under the low-lighting-tag-sale-chandelier motif, we were able to order a salad, tapas, and entrees from the first of several waiters, none of whom were able to introduce themselves, recommend dishes, present silverware, remove plates, or deliver water when asked.
One night we landed at the bar for a late night dinner, and the hanger steak and frites w/ marjoram aioli was the BEST.

The service is sweet and attentive, the wine is delicious and the new wine bar around the corner has the most amazing selection, as well as cheeses and tapas.

I STRONGLY recommend to try something other than typical menu items and go for the short ribs over rice, black cod, sea bass, or duck (there are two dishes that are great).

The advertised unlimited mimosas and bloody marys is too good to be true until you realize that they keep down your drink count because the service is so slow.
I have seen the crowd go from ultra hip to BT and I still love it becuause of the food.
finally, onto dessert, wherebv the waiter told us he would have to scrape the bottom to give us any ice cream.

The limited number of toppings prevented the sogginess described by other reviewers and allowed the intense flavors from the fresh ingredients; sauce, mozarella, basil and black olives to really shine through, without being watered down from too many extra toppings.
We went on a Monday night around 6:30pm and were seated right away in the backroom, which is dimly-lit, casual, cozy--kind of felt like you were sitting in a spacious dining galley of a ship or a cabin.

While the food was good enough (if old-fashioned - my meal tasted like it was out of a fancy 1950s cookbook, all creamy and rich) the environment was sort of bizarre - rich tapestries, yucky corner-grocer roses on the tables, and a strange '80s mirrored wall, which we sat against at the back of the restaurant.
Waitress we had appered to be very impatient, didn't know the name of the fish in English, apptizer came when we were having entree and she made no apology.

Once the waitress cursed our table for not tipping enough after we had waited an hour to order and another half an hour just to get a drink, on top of this I had to find my own cutlery.
I had to physically get out of my seat and find the waitress twice just to ask for more water.
The Food The free chips-and-salsa may suggest casual Tex-Mex cooking, but this menu is a couple notches above.

Chances are the garden out back is hopping, with happy Slopers sipping wines that start less than $20 per bottle and munching on more than a dozen kinds of pressed sandwiches.

The problem was that we waited for a long time to get our waitress, we had to ask the bus boy for refills for drinks, and we waited for a long time to pay for our check.
You cannot beat having the waiter spooning butter over your steak before you are served!!
The bar's waitresses seem to have a sixth sense for when customers have reached the bottom of a drink or are scratching their forks against empty plates.
The staff were friendly, but the food just wasn't that great.
There are no vegetarian items on the menu, but when I requested that the chef make something meat-free for me, he came through with a dish just as delicious and pretty as those my friends were eating.
To be honest, it cost $95 for two adults and a kid (including only two beers for the adults), and the only things worth eating were the raw oysters, information about which the staff was not too sure.
Little Italy-style hambone performances by the waiters (actually saying fugettaboutit 4 times during specials) was embarassing and did nothing to hide the fact of of being charged for 4 bottles of wine when we only ordered 3.
The best dish is not listed on their menu - it is a special - the flat pasta with truffle mushroom sauce.
The waiter recommended I choose a bottle for the entire meal.
when our server accidentally spilled some wine at our table, he cleaned it up offered us another glass right away.
The small shrimp were dry and rubbery and when I sent the dish back to the kitchen, the waitress returned saying that they use 'frozen shrimp so that is wny they have that texture.

The dinner lasted about 3 hours, that waiter continued to refill our water even though we finished the whole meal(including desserts) an hour and half before.
Setting aside the interminable wait for food, the cheese omelet opened up on the way from the kitchen to the table so that when it arrived, it looked like a large yellow pancake with a slab of uncooked cheese sitting in the middle.
the filet came out and was absolutely delicious, on a bed of julienned vegetables in a balsamic vinagarette sauce.
I'm sorry, but the prices at Boi are outrageous for this type of cuisine.
After the appetizers, which were the only saving grace (BBQ chips, spinach, fried bread), the servers descending and without asking started taking our plates away.
There isn't a huge selection of food, but there's something on the menu for everyone to really enjoy.
The waiter made a huge production over what order he should deliver the food, as we all agreed the miso should be eaten with the sushi to aid digestion.
Would go back when I was ordering off the regular menu and give the steak a try.
If you consider throwing food at your when they remember good service, then go for it.
While they adhere to a certain traditionality in serving their teas; eg: samovar for the russian, chinese tea sets for the green, the food labours under no such restrictions and there is nothing ordinary on the menu.

Ignoring the merits of the cuisine (which was par at best), I see no reason why one would pay Da Umberto prices for an okay meal and below average ambience.

Our waiter was very prompt and friendly, but the worst part of the experience was actually after the meal when I was leaving.
The food was definitely good, but when all was said and done, I just couldn't justify it for the price (including 2 drinks, $100/person).
Went for restaurant week and surprisingly on the menu were entree options of Mahi, Mahi, Kobe Beef ribs, Salmon and some other things in very reasonable portions.
The waiter didn't go over the menu choices and at the end of the night we were so fed up we didn't even order dessert.
This place is good but food and service is presented for the masses, not much personalized service considering the price tag and that it is a  full-evening-out type of dinner place.
the tasty food keeps luring me back, but after placing an order with who i assume must be the same rude sunday manager i keep hearing about, i'm not sure i will again.
Portions were certainly substantial for lunch.
You can spend $25 per entree at a much fancier place.
Space gets kind of crowded in there--because it's so popular--but it's worth the wait because the food is very good.
Grabbed a lunch here on a weekday and it was reasonably priced, well-portioned and generally well-prepared.
The Setting The exposed brick and tangerine walls, flickering candles and tiny bar cast a formal mood across this cozy Park Slope trattoria, but the high ceiling fans and two glass walls (left open in warm weather) add a casual breeziness.
great food, even better price, they also have a dj spinning great music, definitely a must try.
The waiters didn't clean it up until they brought our dessert.
The wait staff is friendly and helpful and kudos to the sushi chef Hero who serves up great dishes on and off the menu and is always wearing a smile.
the most expensive dish on the menu was $14!!!
A very pretty setting to have a meal, but unfortunately the service and food don't match the atmosphere.
I visited the Park Slope location on Fifth Avenue, and was impressed with the menu, and that they offered chicken fried steak.
i had a horrible experience with a waiter while trying to have breakfast friday morning.
that the waiting is horrific but the food is great.
To finish, the cost of the dinner was over-priced.

If you are expecting big portions, go find a Cheesecake Factory.
Pastas include shellfish-stocked linguine with tomato sauce, and an excellent homemade cheese ravioli--all are available in half portions.
Good location, but tourist-y and poor quality food.
The menu does not have much and what we did have - original pizza with pepperoni and sausage was not so great.
Their menu has just been updated featuring new rolls and more choices.
Although the pricing is on the more expensive side, this is a must try restaurant for its food.
although the food was well-prepared, it was not worth the price, especially when it does not include dessert!
Watch out for the sesame noodles, though, and leave the complimentary pickled cabbage and carrots sitting on the table for the next customer to enjoy.
The menus took about 15 minutes to come, the menu were already set up for Valentines day the salad was good my dinner was a soup of about 2 or three shrimps, THAT'S IT!
Menu had several fish selections (snapper, salmon, cod) but all were around $30 despite the fact that the portions would hardly fill a child's belly and the sides were 3 pieces of lettuce (literally).
The service can be a bit spotty since they are sometimes busy taking phone orders to attend to the restaurant patrons so make sure you have a lot of time to spare when you go there for dinner.
I find the attitude of the managers to be appallingly superior, and the food below average, at sky-high prices.
mistake on the check, overly salty morels stuffed with foie gras) but overall, Daniel's dishes are revelations in taste.
Particularly good is the chicken verde burrito with a refreshingly spicy salsa that avoids the heat overkill.
The food was pretty good but the portions were smaller than what I would expect for brunch.
While there's a strong Asian influence behind many of the plates, you can't pigeonhole the food into a single genre, as there are Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Italian and American dishes incorporated into this creative menu.
The mussels and fries at this place were amazing!
I politely told our waitress about this and she was not only apologetic, but the manager came over a minute later and apologized and bought myself and my guest another round of drinks.
Delivery wasn't the fastest, but the food was still hot so I won't complain.
Bins of fresh bagels rest behind the counter, and there are always a few customers sitting at one of the few tables inside or on one of two wooden benches out front.
Ten minutes later: no burgers and no sign of our waiter.
Upon entering we were promptly seated and ordered a few minutes after ordering the waiter came out and said they are completely out of crab, crab legs, crab claws everything.
While the food is terrific, you must overlook the often apathetic service, and the sometimes downright rude Manager that seats people.
I went there for a late dinner last night with a friend and the service was aweful.
For the price and quality of the food, the service should have been a lot better than it was.
Great place to get a good fulfilling meal but do not go for ambience or service.
It's always exciting to see celebrities hiding in the corner banquettes or behind sunglasses at the bar, but the real draw is the chef's short ribs and the volumous wine list.
So maybe I'm naive to the latest trends in dining, but I really didn't like it.
), we were not given bread though the couple next to us was, we asked twice for our check and when it came, they forced us to pay the tip in cash so they could get out of paying taxes!
The servers were prompt and attentive, but the food arrived lukewarm (maybe it was served so quickly because it was pre-cooked and had been sitting out for a while) and was not all that flavorful.
We then waited until 7:35 before any food arrived at our table, despite the fact that we kept reminding our waitress that we needed to leave by 7:45.
When the pizza arrived it was definitely hot, however the topping was rather soggy from the moisture from the fresh tomatoes.
The service is almost stifling polite (they pushed in my chair behind me every time I returned from the bathroom), though the sushi chef preparing my food was casual and chatty.
I expected professionals, but was instead met with an amateur waitstaff that made several ominous errors during the course of the meal.
Service was inexcusably, excruciatingly slow- it took more than 30 min to get the first round of drinks, by which point our party was ready to walk out.
We got there early so there wasn't much of a wait -- otherwise, I usually sit at the bar and have a cocktail.
The owner kindly gave us appetizers on the house to make our now, long wait, more pleasant, but of course they took forever to arrive and were insufficient.
The green hair table and seating at the front window was tacky and gimmicky, but figured it's the food that counts.
Myself along with every other patron were forced to wait in an overcrowded bar while employees carry chairs and such over our heads to prepare for dinner in the next room, shoulder to shoulder we stood there like cattle waiting to be fed.
Tried again for Brunch and really bad server with HUGE attitude.
Went for lunch but wanted to order a la carte, which was so highly discouraged by the waiter (pushing the 10.
The Food The pan-Italian menu forgoes the appetizer-entree format in favor of fairly priced small plates, which quickly add up.
The waiter made no effort to remember who had orderd what (just threw it on the table and bailed), or even who ordered (I had to flag him so my wife could order her main dish 15 min after he had taken orders from others).
went there for dinner over the weekend and was treated rudely right away by what I think was a manager who was doing anything but managing.
I was interrupted by the waiter to say that when we are done with dinner he'd bring one.
The food makes up for it, though the quality has fallen victim to it's success.
Get a bottle of wine, and eat what your heart has been desiring because all the things you would love to be on one menu--are!
The food was barely decent and our server was nowhere to be found.
I always trek to Bar 89 and get one of their huge sandwiches that comes with fries.
The Food The seafood-dominant fusion menu features standout starters, like super-fresh raw bar oysters, crispy citrus-pepperoncini calamari and flaky lobster-mushroom tart with fiery chorizo and caramelized onions.
The food and decor is above average, but it is clear the restaurant has bad management and service.
The Japanese folk music blaring on the quaint speakers are a trip and they have some interesting things on the menu like bull pen|s and turkey testicles.
the waitress was probably new, because she had no idea what wine they had, or if they had a certain type by the glass or bottle, and kept going back to the bar to find out.
Olives served at the bar are wonderful.
The only con is the price ($110 for two people for a full meal).
food was just ok,, to many high end places in such a cool lower east side neighborhood,like prune and apizz, prices to high in these places for this hood.
The waitress recommended four courses, not three, given their tiny size.
I was a bit taken aback by the paper napkins and the flyer like menu, but was excited nevertheless to taste the food praised by at least 6 people on this site.
The place was empty except for one table, but they were just having drinks (red flag #1).
Food was much better than the average Indian place in the area, and more interesting.
In addition to Italian staples like pasta, chicken and veal parmigiana, house specials like chicken Giovanni (chicken breast with sausage, sauteed in white wine) and linguini Giovanni (shrimp and clams in red sauce) keep the menu interesting.
Just be sensible, if the wait is 45 minutes or longer--just have sushi there some other time, and eat something else that night.
So, get drinks elsewhere, have a nice dinner here, and stop by the package store on the way home where you can get a bottle of Bombay Sapphire for the cost of 2 drinks here.
One person's dinner was cold, another was charged for a larger portion than ordered, and my shrimp pasta was inedible.

The food was awesome if you can deal with wait staff who you can hardly ever find.
Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.
We waited FOREVER on Valentine's Day for our table because their hostess had lost our reservation BUT the food was worthy of the long wait anyway.
The waiter brought the wrong food and charged us for food and drinks we didn't order.
our waiter from last year, a young man named Chris, actually remembered us (we did speak at length that evening about everything from food and wine to how to create good marrige).
I went back to telly's because i heard that they changed the Chef and the food was again, after a very very small break, was excellent again.
Expect to be cramped and you may have to wait a little for your food, but the service is really friendly and helpful.
Art and miscellany adorn the black-painted walls; strings of colored lights, disco balls and TVs are hung here and there; and on weekends a DJ fills the dining room with loud dance beats.
The portions are not huge, but they do include an alcoholic beverage or fresh juice, so that made up for it.
Although the food was good, it wasn't quite worth the price tag.
During my meal the waiter and waitress gathered with other friends that had arrived and they spent the whole time talking and ignoring the clientele.
Even though it wasn't totally full, the waitress had to RUN around the restaurant, and the drinks and the food took a LONG time to arrive.
After ordering a couple beers from the pleasant bartender, my date and I took a seat at one of MANY vacant tables next to the bar (The bar stools were full).
Had a few appetizers; smoked duck was served cold but good flavor, tofu was good/fresh too, nothing to rave about though.
The price wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt for the poor service, average food, and uninspired menu selections (choice of tiramisu and strawberries with whipped cream for dessert?!
Then the manager said, hey we'll give you shrimp instead, which would have taken another hour.
In Short The vegi burgers (and the full bar) are the main draws: ranging from the Super Veg-Burger with lettuce, tomato and Abijah's secret sauce to the McKate (two un-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, dairy or nondairy cheese, etc.
The food was a meal I could find anywhere else in the city for a better price.
and if that wasn't enough the owner threw in a free beer each for me and my friend.
our waitress (who was ok) disappeared in the middle of our dinner, leaving us to an obnoxious amateur (must answer the phones or something) who could not answer our questions and treated us extremely rudely.
Wait staff started swarming around us as if we just ordered cokes throughout lunch.
Smallish menu, but more than adequate, and not that heavy on sauces which is so typical of italian restaurants.
Besides ordering single dishes you can also order family style.
Even at lunch, when lawyers and publishers flock in to wheel and deal over the justly-popular lunch buffet, the atmosphere remains serene.
I highly recommend the chicken hearts, but remember: ask the waiters, since they're not usually available and will be cooked upon request (and will go fast).
Had a late-night dinner there on Friday, and while the decor is fabulous, we waited a long time for our check.
In the middle of dessert, the waitress silently passes by and drops the check.
The waiter's recommendation for the entree (seabass in a lime and mango chutney) exceeded our expectations and we ate the chutney to the last drop.
For the cost of the lunch I expected much better service.
Even though it's a trek for me to get there and the place is a little of a Hole in the wall, I've gone many times for the food alone.
We sat there with the check and ordered dessert and more drinks.
As a former waitress, I get this conceptually, and I am even understanding of the fact that I had to wait 30minutes to get my first drink because the bar was backed up.
But my lunch was very light with a wrap, not tortilla, but something thinner, a rice paper sort of crepe, that had lettuce and spicy cabbage and thin sliced beef.
And I'm saying that dinner has actually taken about an hour more than it should, just because of the slow service.
Soy abounds, in all forms: as firm patties, pure squares of glistening tofu, and something called a hijiki patty--mixed tastily with shreds of seaweed, then fried.
Evening service--featuring waiters all in black--is a little slow; plan on a leisurely dinner unless you're headed for the theater.
Try the stir fried cube steak, shabu sahbu, or the Oden, or anything else you want to try on the menu.
Within 3 minutes after we sat the waiter was hovering over us to get our food order.
My mouth almost dropped, and for good reason, when the server brought my sandwhich and side of macaroni.
(Note: Price variations were listed nowhere--and I had asked for a to-go drink, deciding--after paying--to sit at a no-service counter until my drink cooled off.
To enhance the dining experience, there is a live jazz band, which further isolates you from the world outside the gates.
Surf-and-turf encompasses the menu's star entrees: deliciously charred sesame-crusted tuna with ginger ponzu gently juxtaposes espresso-rubbed filet mignon.
The menu is quite substantial, with a number of chicken, beef, and seafood specialties not found at your typical chinese restaurant.
Other than the too fruity drinks at the bar which wasn't my cup of tea, everything else was excellent.
The porterhouse is as good a steak you are going to find in NYC or the surrounding area.
My only two complaints are that (1) our server was a real space cadet and kinda inattentive and (2) the sodas were really small; overall, though, I had a great time and really enjoyed my dinner!

This is one of two Ping's in Queens, the other one on Queens Blvd in Elmhurst serves great seafood dishes fished straight off clean tanks.
The place was beautiful, I sat at the bar for two hours and eat oysters and had way too many martinis.
Unfortunately it gets very crowded on the weekends, so if you don't mind dining at the bar you can skip the wait for a table.
If you are under 24 this might seem to be a great place in the big city but for the rest of us it's just a liitle too chheesy and the food is under par for the price.
They spoon the FAT GREASE over your steak when they bring it to the table.
In Short This old-fashioned luncheonette, festooned with artificial flowers and signs touting the cherry lime rickeys, egg creams and banana-walnut pancakes, is favorite pitstop for folks visiting the Brooklyn Museum and Botanical Gardens.
unbeknownst to the three of us, the hostess made note of the fact that i was celebrating my b-day after a member of my dinner party made a very brief reference to it as we were seated.
Although we were seated quickly, ambiance was cozy, service was decent the overall menu selection and overall food taste and presentation was less to be desired!
Count on fresh, fairly priced cuts of fish that represent a good value, even if portions are a bit on the small side.
Food is pretty good but the service is horrific.
Warming clam miso soup and expertly rolled Mexican maki (made with yellowtail, scallions, avocado, and jalapeno mayonnaise) pair well with a stiff glass of shochu, Japanese liquor with a bite as strong as tequila.
The Food Mafrici's approach to modern Italian fare may seem gimmicky: The menu lists eight seasonal ingredients, each prepared as an appetizer, pasta and entree.
The tables are close so you can hear every conversation going on around you, but if you're here with someone who enthralls you, you will notice no one else but your dinner date.

The waiters are very kind and helpful, and I regularly get something on the house - coffee, dessert or a drink.
It takes forever for them to serve you just drinks, and some of the waiters seem to not comprehend what you order.
The waitresses are so nice and will even help you pick a meal if you are new to spanish food.
Once at the table our waitress managed on two occasions to take 15 minutes bringing drinks to our table, our plates sat uncleared on the table for just as long.

I don't know why the place was almost empty until 8PM, but the food and service were perfect for the price.
the sushi was good and the service was not as bad as some would have you think but the crowd was more business than hip, more wall st.
On the other hand, I never felt rushed to vacate the place at the end of my meal.
There were 6 servers standing around watching me eat but they never asked if I needed anything or even offered me water.
But once we spoke up (and they figured out what happened with the menus) they re-did the dish in a butter sage sauce, which was awesome.
I didn't take a look at the rest menu, but the oysters were fantastic.

The food quality is good, but the prices are not worth it!
The waitress didn't seem to know anything about the menu, she forgot our drinks, took away our wine list after I asked to keep it, and then said, I'm sorry, I only slept 3 hours last night.

Ok, so the service can be a little spotty, but despite this Cafe Con Leche has good food, and decent prices.
They've got some of the best french toast you'll ever eat for Sunday brunch, and while their dinner menu hasn't changed much in the past few years, their food is reliable and they I always find something new in their chicken or fish specials, which are usually prepared with a red or white wine-based sauce.
The service is pleasent, but they did forget to bring my mother in law's appetizer.
Good brunch menu - it was hard to make a decision between the breakfast tacos, huevos rancheros, and salads on the menu although our waiter was happy to rank menu items upon our request.
The waiter was able to answer any questions I had about the wine or food.
The crowd is not young, but hey, go somewhere else to get a drink afterward.
Trendy decor doesn't make up for the avg food, adequate service and relatively high prices.
the bread they served as we sat down had a pastry-like crunch on the outside and still warm.

While dining on a delicate lamb carpaccio, and grilled skate wing, the owner explained that due to low lunch-time patronage, they may be discontinuing lunch altogether.

Drinks were well priced and the buyback rate was fantastic.

We were served by two very rude waitresses who slammed every glass and dish they brought onto the table, and then got so caught up by hanging out at the bar that I eventually had to hunt them down to pay my bill.
A server came shortly after that with a cheeseburger, which is not what i ordered.
Went to dinner on a Friday night and the place was packed and hot.
We didn't order-the waiter just kept piling the food in front of us.

As we sat waiting for our menus, we started noticing the frowns on the faces of the people around us, watching as patrons tried to flag down waiters without luck, asking for things like water.

What I thought was a rip off was, when we were ordering, the waiter told us there was a minimum of food we can purchase.
The food *was* pretty good, though, (though certainly not worth the prices) so it's worth checking out if you have an expense account to work with.

We ordered one of the specials our decent waiter mentioned, and one of the chicken dishes off the menu.

On the menu, unusual offerings like mango salad, Kashmiri chicken and whole fish cooked in mustard sauce refute the strip's infamous reputation for one-sauce-fits-all cooking.

my sister asked for iced tea twice and the waitress said they didn't have.
First, we waited 40 minutes for our food, but after a thrity minute wait, the waitress asked me to clarify what I had ordered (I ordered off their menu, with no changes).
Very pleasant atmosphere, not a quiet romantic dinner.
The waiter was nice once he got to us, it took about 5 minutes to get a glass of water and someone to get us started even though it was very slow.
Somewhat agree with the previous reviews about service and the long wait but once seated, the food is well worth it.
The veal was nice and tender, but the flavors weren't exciting.
It is a nice room with a cool bar and you should stop in for a drink and Tapas but dinner was very weak!!!!
Just sit at the bar and sip some amazing Italian wines.
The prices have gone up and some of good old standby entrees have disappeared from the menu.
On the menu board posted outside - they got Passion Fruit Creme Brule.
Ask for a table closer to the bar than in back of the dining area; the drop ceiling the back compromises enjoying the soaring space of Guastavino's.
When we got our bill the drinks were full priced and when we asked, our waitress said that there is no happy hour on the roof.
My only suggestion would be to avoid long waits for food by adding extra servers when there are large groups.
Coffee, treats, and the best of eerything.
a drink or two went by, but as we slowly realized our wait had become an hour from the promised 20 min, the server noted upon our inquiry that they recognized and remembered us and would seat us soon- rolling eye look- matched by a tone protesting the uncouth annoyance.
The scene was sassy and cool, but i would never eat dinner here again.
The food is decent, but for what the bill comes to, it's just not worth it.
Charging full price for half pie toppings, and refusing delivery (1 block) for orders under $20.
Our waitress recommended the coffee flan for dessert, and we didn't regret it.
The attention to detail whether it's decor or service or menu made us feel fortunate to be part of the Camino Sur dining experience.
Our waiter was apparently angry to have to be serving, because it took him 15 minutes to even bring water, let alone take a drink order (it was early on in the day and the restaurant was not even 50% full, so he was NOT busy).
Overall, it is a nice place and if you don't mind possible attitude and the not-so-cheap prices, it is a great place to meet for coffee or drinks (they have a nice selection of that too!
We waited 15 minutes for a menu, another 20 for a tea, another 15 for an appetizer, then when the plates came out, the waitress had to ask me what I'd ordered.
the dishes are a little too recherche and too trendy for their own good and there is not enough on the menu for vegetarians.
the menu looked great, but the food was the biggest disappointment i've had yet!
The Pink Pony's brunch is among the very best in the city!
Only quibbles are so-so wine service, and while Prix-fixe is reasonable at $68, extra charges for additional dishes/tastings can be high.
Fresh fish, tender milk fed veal and outrageous Veal Chops adorn their menu and special list.
Any sandwich or appetizer on the menu is delicious.
Good value for money--especially the $7 lunch special for 2 courses.
The staff were rude and rushed us through our meal, clearing plates and laying down dessert menus while others were still eating their main courses.
Suddenly the manager, came to our table yelling absolutely no way we can have a drink after dinner becuase he has tables waiting Just to be clear we spent over $70 and had 1 drink each, we used the table for about 1hour and 15 minutes.
My friend's entree wasn't presented as described in the menu, but we didn't want to add to the drama.
i thought the food was great but kind of expensive for that atmosphere, the tables were too close and it was too noisy.
I went here for a dinner with some relatives from out of town that I was eager to catch up with, but the noise level at this place made that really difficult!
They later told us that our waiter had to fix the 'computer' - that was the reason he couldn't bring us our drinks.
Our server (after 4 reminders) finally got around to getting our cocktail orders during the meal (at a time when the establishment was not full).
The Scene Petite Abeille is ideal for a lazy lunch, a restorative brunch or light dinner.
After waiting an hour and a half, a delivery man - with heavily bleeding gums - told me not to worry, that my meal had been replaced with fresh food, and that my old order had been RE-SERVED to another customer.
I never have to wait a long time to get my food, so it's a great place to go if you're really hungry and/or in a hurry.
Good Italian spot, but should raise the bar on the food before some newcomers challenge its standings.
went here late night after a a few drinks at my favorite watering spot and was amazed that a place which serves food till 4 can be so damned good.
Although when I went to eat dinner at Bombay Talkie on a crazy busy night, my waiter was extremely helpful through the menu, polite and polished.
What do you like more, completely addictive patties of greasy beef, or glasses of cheap refreshing beer to wash it down?
Yet, the place was emptyIts too bad because the food is authentic and price is very reasonable considering the location and the quality (eg.
the heroes are enough for lunch and dinner.
Then the waiter acted indignant when we called him out for bring us the wrong (later) vintage of wine we picked out.
The food came out really quick and the service overall was not bad.
Every time I eat there I feel as if the chef and waitstaff have cooked, prepared and served a meal as if I am the only customer/guest.
After lunch, we sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender who was also very nice.
We were seated promptly and brought rolls and water but then were made to wait much too long before our beverage order was taken and then much much too long before our waiter came back for a food order.
The service was good and the price was decent but it wasn't enough to overcome the bland tasting food and the bland decor of the restaurant.
But other comfort foods are also superb: Scallion pancakes are delectably crispy yet chewy, and chow fun with shredded pork and preserved cabbage (it's not on the menu) offers a tangy rice-noodles retake on the usual lo mein.
The waiter was pleasant and I thought how bad could someone screw up basic Italian food?
While the appetizers, entrees, and desserts arrived in a timely manner, our water glasses maintained consistently empty (at one point one of us had to ask for water twice!)
We were first greeted by a very friendly hostess who asked if we had reservations - even though we didn't they were VERY accommodating - we sat at the bar and spoke to the VERY nice bartender who recommended a GREAT wine and gave us some brucetta to munch on while we waited.
We had to ask for water even after we were asked what type we preferred, and then the busboy spilled it while he was pouring it out.
Arriba Arriba has much better food, margs, and atmosphere with slightly higher prices, but well worth it.
Corner Bistro, despite the hoopla and critical praise, is nothing more than a burger joint with long lines.
I was thinking I am gonna have a nice dinner in that place that a friend of mine recommended to me , but beside the expensive prices that it has was nothing more.
Despite almost flawless service, I had my birthday there for a party of 15 and we were given a private area on the top floor, which was so cold, we had to keep our jackets on throughout the entire meal.
Trish, our waitress was really great - the food was mediocre.
The Food Mi Nidito's menu offers a considerable array of Mexican standards, with a separate page for seafood, such as King crab enchiladas, and another for vegetarian dishes such as almond-sauteed vegetables.
After finally choosing banana-macadamia nut pancakes (a Hawaiian favorite of mine) after being unable to decide between 4 or 5 dishes that all sounded spectacular, I sat back and enjoyed the (complementary) tall shot glass of the smoothie of the day.
Although Sweet Melissa's food and pastries are very tasty, the unfriendly folks who work there sour the experience.
The food is pretty good, and so is the service, though on my first visit I told the waitress I wanted my tuna black-and-blue and she had no idea what that was.
Unlike some of the other reviews here, the reservation was upheld, the waiter took the time to explain each dish and frequently asked if we wanted more of anything (which we did, several times).
In addition, our waiter seemed to have short-term memory loss because he kept forgetting to bring us our drink order even after I asked him on three separate occasions.
Anyway the food was really good, the portions are not big however very filling and exceptionally good.
I found my dinner to be a bit on the heavy side and blamed the large portions.
While the environment is still fun and diverse, the food quality has been sliding lately.
I agree with the other poster who wrote about the service: the waiter challenged every single dish we ordered with a special (I've never had a more money hungry waiter) and after waiting 20 minutes for the check we had to call the manager over; who was unapologetic.
After all that, the waiter tried to backpedal saying its too hard to time the cooking of miso soup with the sushi bar offerings.
That bastion of authentic Mexican food in Spanish Harlem that earned raves by white reviewers, leading other gringos to nervously venture to Spanish Harlem and pretend they're trendy to pay too much for food that is only marginally better than the place around the corner.
The last two didn't come to the people who ordered them until they already had there food ( in which then we had to remind the staff of).
Expect to get average food, a big bill and lots of attitude from the service.
The bartender ignored us for 10 minutes before asking what we'd like to drink although we were the only people waiting for a table when we walked in.
it did fill up pretty quickly for lunch, but nobody seemed to have to wait too long, and i'm guessing they might be less busy for dinner.
My roommate says she has had good food here at night, at the bar.
I would say it's suitable for a romantic date or quiet family meal, as there is no bar so the atmosphere is a little quiet.
Once in the oven (electric, mind you), he shifts pies every few seconds to attain nicely-charred, chewy crust perfection.
The restauarnt is Ok in terms of decor, but the food was really lacking - things were not cooked to order.
The Food Surprisingly tasty Texas-style barbecue gives this place culinary flexibility beyond that of most wrap-and-burrito shacks.
After 10 minutes of waiting, he finally returned to the table and snootily explained to us that the wine he had opened was actually better and more expensive (not yet on the menu, of course), but he would charge us the price of the bottle we had originally ordered.
Room is impressive, but service is slow and taste was almost like fast food.
We had to flag the waitress down to get a drink refill and waited an extrodinarily long time for our entrees.
I can't speak on the food, but I went there for a show the other week and here is my experience: one of the friendliest servers ever (no attitude); the drinks were avg.
Not the most beautiful environment, but the food is consistently delicious and the barbeque is fun and tasty.
I took a few clients for lunch and the service was lackluster, food was fair at best, and the prices were outrageous - Don't wast your time with this place !
The menu ranged from standard (steak, duck and mussels-all fantastic) to curious (ostrich-awesome, and tartare-smoked not raw but still so good.
Nothing beats being served platters of shrimp and wings and pitchers of beer, by the HOTTEST waitstaff in NY!!!!
Oh yeah, the food's just alright for the price.
It's a great place, the terrific service carried out throughout the night as we sat and got some appetizers and then decided to stay for a bottle too!
I had the item that they forgot to put on the menu; some very tasty fish over jasmine rice with shrimp.
Waiter had to lean on my husband to give people next to us their food.
The wait staff pushed us to get desserts immediately after we finished our main course and we had to continuously tell them we are not ready yet.
Go have a drink there the space is beautiful and buy an appetizer maybe, but pass on dinner, not well cooked and small portions.
i've had practically everything on their menu as i dine out alot but their burgers and mussels with fries are what bring me there every friday night.
The entertainment is awesome - and believe it or not, I was so impressed with one of their musicians/singers (named Alessandro) that I even had him play during my cocktail hour.
This is authentic Japanese food - California roll is not on the menu.
Space aside, service is ok but the food is really well done.
When you feel like eating again an hour later (portions are small) at least you won't feel as regretful about ordering take-out.
Evening started out nice w/ complimentary glass of champagne, but turned sour as mussels were extremely overcooked, steak came in kid size portion smothered with sauce and owner recommended a wine special off the standard wine menu that was double the price of the most expensive bottle but made no effort to describe the wine as extremely special or significantly more expensive that what they typically serve.
The place is not fancy, but their food is wonderful.
This is a don't miss if you are anywhere close to the area, but if you're going for lunch, be there by noon to avoid a wait.
' When I reasoned with them that my dining partner already received her hot entree and was halfway done eating, and all I ordered was two rolls, the wait staff finally got the idea that maybe they should be trying to get me my order.
Had an OK dinner that was made better by the attention the owners pay to the patrons.
It's just nice to have a place like this - a sit down place with a lot of food choices, not centered on a particular ethnicity and a bar - as an option here.
We had to wait 20 minutes before getting a beer, and we never got our burger order.
The menu features mild versions of Lone Star state favorites, from double-basted baby back ribs and steak fajitas to red-beef chili and deep-fried onions.
he politely asked about what happened, we told him about the hostess behaviour, the manager apologized for the her behavior and treated us to a drink at the bar.
I've heard such wonderful things about Pluck U and had the pleasure of trying their infamous chicken while having learned a few things: 1) rushed service 2) limited menu 3) semi-reasonable 4) overly popular.
nice and cozy place but the soup was cold, the pizza was cold.
The Food There's a trimmed-down version of the regular Blue Ribbon menu--all manner of sandwiches, and a solid selection of American main courses--but the real attraction is the vast, well-edited range of cheese, fish and vegetable portions (goodies like foie gras terrine aside, the meat selections are disappointingly indistinct).
Still, after all the fuss, the food makes you forget about the wait.
The wait staff was attentive without being overbearing, and our waiter gave thoughtful advice on dishes that would be suitable for the children.
The prices weren't bad though - dinner ended up at $80 with tip and we had a couple drinks as well.
They always greet me and my friends warmly, deliver food promptly, are happy to answer questions about the menu, and they almost always throw in a free dessert at the end of the meal!
$45 a head with tip for bad gnocchi, mediocre wine (as recommended by a condescending waiter, who thought himself oh-so-nice) and the feeling that our companions (at our shared table) were listening in on all our chatter.
Our cocktails were ok but at ridiculous dance club prices.
The food is great and I found it to be fresh and the prices are below to average compared to other Greek Restaurants.
Once we eventaully got seated (all tables are practically on top of each other), we were hustled through our meal by a waitstaff that clearly knows how quickly they need to turn the table over.
I went for dinner at Lucy the other night with five friends and it was the best experience I've had in a long time.
The only apparent flavor in any of the dishes was heat, and a table of four gourmands left at least half of our meals on our plates.
The dessert was as good as the waiter said it would be.
The Food The menu is better suited to the snacking at the long bar than dining in the compact dining area.
After asking several different people find our waiter, he returned to say he couldn't find any wine and begged us to order sake instead.
Summary - good food which they rush you through and do everything to up your bill.
The high light was the fondue, that we never got because again the server said the kitchen was too busy.
The waiters have been there for YEARS and they know their steak is amazing.
The deli-diner-soul-food menu, featuring everything from matzo balls to barbecued chicken and ribs to 10-ounce burgers, is available until late.
Very claustrophobic place so expect it to be really crowded during lunch.
Not the best ambience and the service is sometimes just mediocre, but the quality of the food is incredible.
I have to say that I've been there only during brunch time but the service even though slow, it was good.
The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.
The portions are like a buffett for breakfast.
Service is FAST so if you are dining, order entrees after receiving apps.
Dinner is okay - not many vegetarian options, and the portions are small.
When the manager was asked for things did imporve but 2 hours to get our meal.
Bread bar couldn't get anything right except water refills (good job to the water guy).
Service was slow and spotty; had to flag the waiter down many a time to get drink and food orders in.
Although the place had an actual makeover not long ago, the food or chef needs to be changed.
The place looks like the inside of a factory, with its steel drums, over-amped A/C and hard wooden benches, and the industrial decor seeps into overly streamlined menu and passionless food.
I had to try the sweet tea, which was served in a plastic cup at room temperture.
I can only say that the soup dumplings are almost as good as Joe's Shanghai and some dishes I had (like Eight Spice appetizer) were tasty while others (Shanghai style Shumai) were less so.
We were a large group and would highly recommend all the drinks and foodThe manager on duty was understanding that our friends were very late and held our reservation.
Start off with an expertly mixed cocktail or glass of wine at the beautiful bar.
The wait staff is slow, full of attitude and forgettful--often taking 20 minutes to bring another round of food and drinks.
The menu contains both Japanese fusion and plain Italian dishes - everyone should be able to find something they like.
The Scene The consistent lines at this bustling Japanese tapas hot spot don't lie: Yokocho's fresh, reasonably priced comfort food and social atmosphere draw a youthful clientele of cultural natives and gaijin alike.
Upon reading the $44 prix fixe menu (a fair price for good food), we realized half of the Appetizers and Entrees required an additional supplement ranging from five dollars to $105!
There are times when there is a long wait at lunch so be safe and make a reservation.
Our meal was interrupted several times by the arguments between our waiter and the maitre 'd.
for ANYONE to come and take our dessert order (we had previously seen our waitress going outside for a cigarette break and never coming back).
Evidently, our waiter went to the Mediterrean for our humus pita because it took about 25 minutes.
The Food There's no need to slump into a well-known comfort zone of teriyaki and udon.
I'm not going to trash the place simply because I had a bad experience there, but here's the facts: the food is very good, the portions are small-to-medium, and the prices are large.
The bar was a disaster because there were no tables for anyone, and drinks took 20 minutes to receive.
For spending over $100 per person for dinner, i would think that the waiter would put my plate of food down for me instead of handing me my dish.
I have told so many people to come here even my friend from Japan and we all love it, especially when we get the room for all of us to sit in our own little world eating tons of good sushi!
it's one of the cheapest eats in the city and the food is not bad if you sit at the bar only - they have a decent chicken and/or beef tender tips but they cook with a lot of garlic so beware.
The staff is constantly disappearing from the restaurant, making it impossible to get drink refills or to get the check.
They bought the same surly staff, it still took way too long for food, drink, ANY SERVICE and the food is still $ 12.
Overall, I would rather go to a chain coffee house up the street for the same priced coffee, but a much more relaxing atmosphere, and no one forgetting my order.
Cheese on the bottom, sauce on top - not too thick or doughy.
I went for lunch yesterday and had a lovely time.
yes as I sat at the table waiting just under 1 HOUR for my food, i was quite tempted to step across the road for a quick snack.
Forget Brunch- there are usually people waiting outside, although the brunches are delish as well!
Don't expect trendy atmosphere: room looks like it could have been designed in 1940s, but who cares - it's actually comfortable and inviting; with great food and unbeatable value, you can't go wrong.
The pizza is baked in a wood burning oven and the flavor is fantastic.
Our waitress was pleasant but slow, and the food is simply not good enough to be treated like a nuisance.
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.
Although we were seated right away and the waiter brought menus promptly as well as drink, he was almost never at our table despite being at the other tables right next to ours.
The waiter was conspicuously eyeing our table the entire meal and there was a lot of scurrying by the wait staff in general.
We were rudely told by the waiter that chips are only available at the bar.
AND, the waitstaff likes to lick its fingers when cutting cakes/pies and serves hot and cold drinks by holding the glass or cup around the brim/top.
Disappointed in the selection on the restaurant week menu (which did not include any steak entrees) but impressed with the actual food- everything was very good- fresh and innovative- saffron risotto was not too powerful and the entrees were all good.
Its not cheap, it was $10 for a burger and fries, and when i was there, the waiter had dropped a FULL glass of coke on a patron, soaking her through!
The specials of the day are the way to go.
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
Curries are another menu highlight, with several choices including Pa Nang with coconut milk, lemongrass leaves, onions and peppers, and Gang Paa with hot and spicy chili sauce.
The only downer was the fruit fondue desert from the prie fixe menu wasn't as good as it looked (the chocolate was runny), and the wait between our salad and main course was too long.
The food was very good but the portions are pretty small, so while the prices are low, the place is not quite a bargain it seems to be.
The service was unattentive and the only time she came over was to aggressively push drinks on us.
For the price you pay, you get good quality and deliciously thin sliced beef.
Our waitress brought him a regular coke instead of a diet coke, and the salsa had OIL floating at the top.
The Scene Cooing couples find some formality and open air up in the front room, while the subterranean back area offers hunkered-down seating for loungier dining.
This is definitely not a place to come for lunch because you can get the same food from a corner deli at half the price they charge here.
For example, the last time I was there the bartender seemed visibly irritated that I would ask him for a drink instead of the waitress.
The food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including dessert.
I went for lunch and the staff does not welcome you upon entering.
I've had the ribeye, the salmon, and a burger/fries at the bar, and they were all exceptional.
I had the lentils and cous cous for lunch the next day because my friend and I had appetizers before our entrees-- portions are pretty decent for the price, and tasty to boot.
We asked for a side of dressing but the waiter told us that all the salads just had oil and vinegar so we should just use the oil and vinegar that was on the table.
Growling at us when we asked for water is one thing, but to just lie and make NO effort to satisfy, or apologize at these moderately high prices ($12.
My advice: go the bathroom at home, and then go to Ginza for EXCELLENT sushi and service.
Our meal was capped of with the waiter rudely saying he needed the table for other customers.
but the Server informed us that they wanted to make the soup their own and that she hopes we like it.
The hostess had us wait in the bar while our table was set up and we ordered what had to be the best mojitos in the city.
While the restaurant/space itself isn't so great (somewhat cramped cheesy interior, and the name implies its a burrito take-out place), the service and food outway its few cons.
The music was a bit loud but the song selection was great, so we blew off desert and had another round of drinks at the bar.
Heartland is the best place in mid-town to grab a beer after work and meet the cuties that work in the building.
The service was nice, although our food took longer than usual to arrive because it had been brought to the wrong table and accidently eaten.
The server was dutiful yet insincere, the brunch drinks above average.
It looks like a dive but serves up fresh authentic Mexican fare you won't normally find in your average Tex-Mex style restaraunt.
The food was very good but portions were small.
I went there on my 2nd day in New York ever for a quick lunch and ended up staying and chatting with the owners wife and a waiter, Javi for two hours.
The menu offered unique options and my friends enjoyed their food, but my lentil avacado salad was not better or more interesting than the lunch counter at Saks and my John Dory was overcooked.
The food was delicious, and the menu provided ample choices which suited all of the eaters in our party from the most daring to the most conservative.
While waiting for a table, tried to get a drink from a bartender who seemed more interested in arguing with his waiters.
The chef insisted that the meat was cooked properly!?
I looked for months for a reasonably priced place that could accommodate about 40 people for a wedding rehearsal dinner on a Friday night.
I had dinner here with a few friends recently, and while I must admit that the food and service was okay, the prices simply did not match the environment and cuisine.
The birthday girl's dessert included a candle the staff came by with birthday wishes.
Our meals were a moderate portion and they weren't too spicy.
Although she was obviously busy, she was helpful in describing certain items on the menu and suggested a duck dish that was out of this world.
We had no problems with our resevations and found the service and the meal well worth a wait, had we run into one.
The place was a bit noisy, but sitting on the edge of the restaurant helped, and although the portions were small, w/ an appetizer it was the perfect amount of food.
Although the sushi was fresh, I was disappointed with the size of the portions for the price.
Sure the food was - as always - very good, but we were quite outrageous about the waitress.
After our disappointing meal and terrible service we asked to speak to the manager (who was sitting alone having a glass of wine) when we were told he was too busy to speak to us!
Yesterday they had numerous bartenders as well as servers and the place wasn't packed and it still took 1/2 an hour to make a martini.
The waiter handed us menus consisting of about 7 entrees, and after telling us the specials, informed us that there was no chicken.
Well, no secret that a brunch here on Saturday or Sunday will be a long wait - but once you bite into those pancakes, it will have been worth every minute.
We had to remind the waiter to pour our wine (white) and then he didn't show us the label.
same atmosphere but food was better before years ago- octopus was like chewing a rubber tire- dumplings tasted artificial.
The food and beer make up for it, but it would be nice if the staff weren't such buzz kills!
I highly recommend the potato and cheese pierogis and the polish kielbasa entreesbut the real stars on the menu are the sides.
Although my waiter had about as much personality as a dead fish, I loved the great solid food and would definately go back.
The atmosphere was so fun that we decided to have another cocktail at the bar and enjoy the scene.
Dinner's nothing to scream about (although there are a few winners on the menu), but solid margaritas and appetizers are well-suited for a summer evening.
I was disappointed to hear another waiter (or it could've been the owner) was reading completely different specials (most of which I would've wanted to try if I didn't overhear at the end of our meal) to the table next to us.
Alongside the USDA prime dry-cut steaks, the menu features standard steakhouse fare: appetizers like shrimp cocktail, fresh oysters and clams, an array of salads, soups, pastas and vegetable sides, and non-steak entrees like lamb, veal and pork chops, lobster and more.
But the price tag was high, and the food was comparable to a Las Vegas buffet for flavor and quality.
Forget about the staff and go for the food and pleasant, if a bit cramped Lancaster, Pennsylvania like decor for comfort.
I mean Pho Viet Huong is at a good location, but face it, the broth is cloudy and oily -they're supposed to constantly dump the top layer off of the Pho broth, service is ran with attitude who cares about you, I have plenty of other customers to make money off of.
The lengthy menu includes the likes of mee krob (glass noodles with shrimp, chicken and pork in plum sauce), nur-yang-num-tok (barbecued flank steak served with a spicy sauce), pork with chili and basil leaves and spicy, bean curd coconut milk soup.
The Food The fun factor is high on the menu of experimental, multi-ethnic shared plates.
Although it lacks the patina of places like Peter Luger's and Sparks, it still has a steakhouse's telltale wood paneling, chalkboard specials and decorative wine bottles.
This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.
The food is just ok, not really memorable and not what you expect for the price but I guess the atmosphere is what you pay for.
The food was good but for the prices, it was definitely not worth it.
The menu is varied but I think it is the chicken which they do best as.
We waited over 30 minutes to get our drinks (which were brought over my the manager) and we could not find anyhting that looked interesting on the menu.
While the food was good (certainly no Il Mulino) the service was horrendous.
the regular prices looked pretty expensive (~$15 per appetizer, ~$35 per entre) so the restaurant week menu (at $35pp) seemed like a sweet deal.
Went there a few months ago, and while the food was really good, and I was ready for it to be pricey, the one thing that bothered me was the waiter was standing in a corner watching us eat.
I came in for brunch with my parents on Saturday and the place was packed.
While the space is exceptionally small and the seating can be uncomfortable, the food is well worth the few inconveniences.
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.
Food and service were very good but prices were a bit high for the portions.
The new fall menu has a black cod with miso broth so good I thought I was at Nobu.
Went for lunch the bartenders were great, also they had a DJ playing music during the day, there was a Huge screen tv playing music videos and a bunch of other tvs with all the sports you could look at.
and don't be ashamed to ask for more during the hour long wait for your entrees.
The only drawback is that the tiny cafe can only hold so many people with even less tables available, so if you are lucky enough to score a table, stay put with a date and some wine, because no place nearby can serve so much romance with such quality eats.
The candle-lit bar is the destination of trendy wine-sippers and snackers, and the rustic-chic dining room, with brick arches that open onto a tight sidewalk terrazza, is booked weeks in advance.
I used to live in Japan, and have had some pretty good raw fish, but I was blown away by the Chef's tasting plate, which includes 6 appetizers including a stunning octopus portion and some incredible sashimi.
I liked the place and the people, but we really went to have dinner no appetizers as the whole dinner.
Our waiter was a bit weird as well, but the lounge area looked like a nice place to get a drink after work.
The service was really bad at several points our waiter would just leave for a cigarette for like 10 minutes while we waited for him to get us another drink or even pay the bill.
I took 8 clients to lunch and was appaled by the overall service.
deserts were slow to order as waiters passed us twice, even with the menus closed.
12/24/03  Dinner was ok, service was so- so,the worst part was the hostess - we made reservations a month before Christmas Eve for three people, you would think the table would be large enough for all three of us.
So if he can't find fresh-good product, he'll remove a dish from the menu which I think is fantastic.
There are some reviews complaining about the menu but I had the same dish the first three times that I was there - and any specials that I have had have been excellent.
The final blow came when the waitress scorned our 16% tip for the meal.
Recommend eating at the bar for an intimate, relaxed dinner.
When the food arrived, the portions were really small, and didn't really reflect the awesome descriptions on the menu.
We ordered the Tuna a la carte and Wild Salmon and chicken breast on the Prix Fixe.
oh, and if you're there for drinks at 3:30 on a weekday afternoon, when the place is empty - and ask for a bread basket - they'll charge you $6.
Only problem was - an older gentleman (well-dressed but a little enebriated) chose to sit down right next to me - despite the fact that all 15 other seats were free - order himself a martini, and then describe how dry and dissapointing the burger was when he ordered it a few days ago.
You can't fault them for serving up some pretty good food, even if it's a bit overpriced.
Bartender made a bad drink for me and I sent it back and was charged for it.
The bar has a large selection of beers on tap,bottles or cans.
Waited 30 min for a brick they call bread and water, another hour for food (tiiiiiiiny portions).
My friends and I dropped by on a Sunday, and there was absolutely NO SERVICE (the supposed only female bartender even told us there was no one else but her, and given that there were people in there waiting to dine and drink, that was ridicoulas!
Waiter spilled a decent amount of water on my friend's plate -and then walked away - didn't remove the plate!
our waiter noticed it was my bday w/o me saying, and brought me cake w/ candles.
The decor is not special at all but their food and amazing prices make up for it.
Rather you are paying rock bottom price for a meal that could cost you triple any where else.
The portions are big so you can split an appetizer.
In the front bar, boisterous neighbors and friends share bottles of wine; the large dining room, with its lovely painted ceiling and oversized portrait of a portly chef, is the destination for serious eating.
The calamari, the penne and vodka sauce, the friendly service the parking and the open area kitchen to see all the action in the making!
I've never been able to find a lunch place in the midtown with the same quality and service, until now.
Among us, we ordered a large sampling of the menu, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal.
Service was unbelievably on target down to the smallest detail; our waiter invited us to sample a new desert under consideration for their menu and a new line of ice wines.
In addition, the manager refused to come over to apologize - but told the waitress to offer us TWO desserts on the house- when there were FOUR people dining.
The waiter disappeared after dropping off the food so I had no choice but to eat it as is.
I did not find the wait staff to rude at all, how involved do you really want them in your meal right?
Half way through the meal my husband had to go to the bar to order his own beer, since the server never came back.
To the amusement of our server, I wrote everything down, lest I forget a single morsel (about 21 different dishes).
Order the porterhouse and they put it between you and you kind of eat family style at a wooden table.
It's just a diner, but three decent hearty lunches for 12 bucks?
Comfort standbys--including bacon-wrapped meat loaf and barbecued ribs, and upscaled interpretations--like tuna club made with wasabi mayo, share space with brunch favorites (Belgian waffles, fluffy buttermilk pancakes and wrecked eggs, or tofu).
In other words, conserative types craving simpler things like grilled chicken or salmon probably would not appreciate Tabla's distinctive and unusual menu.
I write that in quotes becuase iceberg lettuce, stale Pepperidge Farm croutons and bottled dressing does not a salad make.
The menu sticks to standard Italian dishes--linguine with clam sauce, chicken parmigiana, and fettuccine Alfredo--but the reasonable prices add to the charm.
The waiter nearly yelled at me when I asked for more water.
When I asked for a particular drink, the waitress gave me dirty look and annoyed b/c they didn't know what it was.
WAY OVER PRICED , HAD MUCH BETTER MEALS FOR JUST OVER HALF THE PRICE IN PLACES JUST AS NICE.
then, the waiter had nerve to charge me for the fruit salad and bloody mary (which we didn't drink) that came with the omelet (brunch special).
I had the waiters bring back so much meat that that asked me if I wanted Flank steak for dessert.
This was followed by various wacky hijinks: overly sweet foie de gras, lack of extra ginger/soy sauce, minute portions even for sushi, appetizers arriving at different times.
I ordered dessert and it was they gave me the wrong flavor of ice cream.
We started at the bar with a nice bottle of wine, which was priced fairly and sampled several different cheeses.
A 3 course-meal took 2 1/2 hours, including 20 - 30 minutes waiting to get the check after dessert.
The food was abundant and good but wasn't worth the unpleasant wait.
The rolls are tiny so you have to order more anyway and they will often get your order wrong if you stray from the menu.
Into our appetizer, an adjacent table became available, and we asked if we could use it, but the waiter said it most likely was being used.
The service has always been outstanding and even when we didn't have a reservation they worked something out, where I agreed to keep our meal to just eating.
In Short The bi-level dining room, which resembles a bamboo-thatched hut, is a brightly-lit, wide-open space with high ceilings and laminated depictions of Indian village life.
At least the entertainment was free, as we were able to witness one customer wooing a waitress, and another being drenched in milk.
The table next to us recommended that share because the portions are big(we split two entrees)The food was so good I wish that there was some left over to take home for the next day.
We were immediately seated (the restaurant was no where close to being packed, surprise, surprise) There are very few selections on the menu and the food is not that great and the dining experience at Butter is completely overrated.
When our entrees came, at least 3 or 4 waiters / waitresses came by at different times to wish us bon apetit.
Good food, but bad service.
The waiters actually roll their eyes when you order something, as if you are imposing on them by ordering food.
My reservation for 2 was during lunch and it seemed that because I was literally 2 minutes late, the hostess felt the need to seat every party before mine.
We had to wait an hour before our food was served, then another hour inbetween courses, all the while whilst the staff were naughtily hiding in an attempt to avoid our 'where's out food?'
It was also very reasonably priced, we had 4 bottles of wine, appetizers, dinner, and coffee and our bill was just over 50 per person.
While I would agree with the initial review that Asia de Cuba isn't really Asian or Cuban in its decor, the food was a nice fusion.
Only drawback is the sound level - quite a loud space downstairs - and that might be accounted for with their trendy bar and right off Times Square.
The menu is Prix Fixe, so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person, but it is Well worth itsuperb food.
The Food It's billed as Asian street food, but since the menu is a creative collaboration between expert chefs Vongerichten and Gray Kunz, dishes show unmistakable finesse.
Al Di La serves up an impressive selection of options ranging from meditarranean fish to rabbit to to duck to pasta.
when someone from our table of 5 asked the waitress for refill on water, she comes back and fills only that person's glass, leaving the rest of the table with almost empty glasses.
We told the manager it was not worth a few appetizers to be treated that way and left.
The food is decent, but WAY TOO SMALL of portions for what you pay for.
We would have to flag down the bored looking wait staff to refill our tea.
Watch out for the overworked, stressed out waitress who dumps tapa dishes on the table and leaves w/out announcing what it is.
I would not recommend this place until they get a new staff that can complement the food.
The food was pretty good, but due to our large size (~16) the manager asked us to limit our appetizers to just 3 selections b/c he didn't want to overburden his cooks.
Our waitress seemed less than happy about the prix fixe dinner choices and at one point said, Do you really need to hear the specials?
On the table you will also find individual bottles of fine imported olive oil which we put on the bread-fantastic!
Then the staff behind the buffett just haven't gotten their groove yet, so you order your food and wait five minutes while it sits behind the glass on a plate, getting cold.
They are negligent in alerting customers when an order is ready - you could end up waiting for half an hour while your food is sitting on their counter getting cold.
The bar tender didn't know where the tea was, waiters started making the drinks if the bar tender wasn't around.
It took forever to seat us even though the restaurant was almost completely empty, then we had to ask to be waited on, it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks, and then another 30 minutes to get our salad and then even more time to get our pizza and then our bill.
The waitress/hostess seemed a bit sad when we told her we weren't ordering dessert (those arepas are deceptively filling!
yes Shrimp not lobster (those are 6 Lbs) try the exotic Fish not on the menu and a must have is the Flower stuffed with lump crab meat.
The House salad is big enough to split, The Fried Calamari is some of the best I ever ate, the bowties broccoli, broccoli rabe, square slices, broiled filet of sole, clam sauce.
I have a litany of complaints -- being over-charged for wine that I didn't order, shady waiters, so-so food that arrived at the table luke warm, main course portion sizes barely large enough to be appetizer sizes, lack of fabulosity that Mr.
Unlike the reviewer before me, what made me KEEP going back was the great reception I received from the bouncers and I needed several cocktails to endure the waitstaff.
We were the only two people sitting out front and the waiter was unable to provide us with attentive service OR our dinner.
We finally flagged down another server who brought us more to drink, and then they took forever with the check.
The waitress forgot our coffee, took forever to take our order, never checked in with us after the food came and when we were done, didn't bring us the check for the longest time.
Wish the Greenwich street location had more seating like their 2nd Ave location, because one invariably leaves it smelling of grease.
Aside from that, the service is adequate (visible, and will help you if you ask, but lack initiative), and the food, well, could be a lot worse.
For a restaurant with such limited menu and wine list, each dish should better be darn good.
Waitress kept trying to get us to order more drinks while apologizing but wouldn't even bring bread to keep us from starving.
Both appetizers arrived cold/luke-warm, which we had to send back, only to have the waiter tell us that one was supposed to be cold.
The Food Consulting Chef Douglas Rodriguez's forte is blending the diversity of traditional Latin cuisine with modern culinary chic: A celery sorbet cools the spicy-citrus bite of lobster; shrimp seviche and crunchy green plantains coat thick, juicy halibut resting on sweet plantain hash; and tart tomato escabeche moistens a chewy skirt steak.
The perfect meal; delux combo raw bar as an appetizer, King crab as your entree.
The place was not crowded for dinner on a Sunday night at 8:30pm.
Meat wasn't fall-off-the bone (a sign of over-cooking) but was tender and had deep flavor.
The waiter came back after I had finished my appetizer to correct himself and let me know that it wasn't vegetarian (chicken stock) after all.
Food took over an hour despite at least two chasers, we had to track the server down to get extra drinks, the manager seemed to try and deliberately mislead us about the reason behind the delay and in the end the food was poor.
The waiters are nice, but weren't particularly good - waited forever to order and resented not being told that my dinner companion and I had ordered enough for a table of 10 (given the size of the sushi).
The place is very loud, good for drinks by the bar not to eat and yell.
The Scene Less trendy than Plan Eat Thailand, less crowded than Veracruz and infinitely more charming is Bean, a Mexican spot on Bedford Avenue's college-town-like stretch.
50, I got the Paella Marinera which was beyond filling in itself, but before it even came, the waitstaff provided more than ample appetizers for my group that by the time that the meal came to us, we were so stuffed, we could barely finish up the meal.
I thought the bar was fair in terms of decor, but how long do you have wait at the bar before a bartender with an attitude (he wasn't rude, but not friendly) makes you an awful drink, but food was delightful and music light and tasty as well.
The Food A good way to judge a Thai spot is by its green curry: The all-Thai staff here fashions it spicy and smooth, filled to bursting with meat and thin-sliced bamboo shoots.
Their menu is limited, they serve miniscule omelettes that may be suitable for a child (with what seems like a teaspoon of stuffing) with a salad (have to pay even more for fries) for $10- which was poorly washed and there were bits of soil all over it!!
the place looks cool, but the food is not really that good.
Spend your time sitting on one of their couches enjoying a cocktail from the bar.
I will have to say the food was good and the chance to sample wines not often found in other restaurants was a positive but the abyssmal service left a bad taste.
I don't know why people complain about the service - our waiter brought our drinks and food out promptly.
And the service is unbearable - I waited for ages to get my drink, got the wrong sushi order, and had my appetizer whisked away prematurely.
Once they took our wine order, it took 45 minutes for it to arrive, even though the waiter was talking to a patron next to us.
In Short Though it's more of a takeout and delivery operation than a sit-down restaurant, Risotteria does offer eight small tables for those who want to savor their risotto hot off the stove.
The space was unique (even though looking out the skylight windows on a tenament was a bit odd) and the service, happily, was fine.
The food and cocktails at SushiSamba were very good; however the seating is so tight and uncomfortable and the service so rushed that I will probably never go back.
The kitchen turns out a long list of American bar food staples, like burgers and fries.
One price for dinner left for no surprises.
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
This is one of my first dining experiences in NYC when I first moved here 10 years ago, and although Hudson Corner is consistently good, it has gone downhill over the years in both food quality and service!
Food turned out to be descent, but the waitress disappeared from the moment we placed the order untill she came back with the check.
We asked for more coffee, water and couldn't even get that from our server.
The waiter kept coming up and asking to take our plates while we were still eating and the manager stood and stared at us through half our meal!
The service was fine, out appitizers took forever to come out, and then they dumped the rest of the food on us, without giving us a chance to enjoy our appitizers.
Great deal for lunch; came to something like $11 with tip and tax!
The Food Pies come in three sizes, from a petite five inches (perfect for the solo diner) up to 10.
I'd recommend going across the street to Recharge for some healthy burgers and fries before hitting the bar.
But when the bartender messes up the returned drinks something is wrong.
Order ended up being double the price of a normal lunch.
The waitress lost some points for not refilling our champagne glasses.
Although the homefried potatoes were not worth the plate space, next time I'll ask to substitute a nice salad.
The waiter (someone I know has been working there since it was just LCB) POURED MY WINE FROM THE DIRTY GLASS INTO A CLEAN ONE AND SERVED IT TO ME!
In addition, they lack basic ammenities like a toaster, and the decor was shabby, at best.
The only blemish was our waitress, who left us with empty drinks for quite a long time.
The steaks are just as good, with an assortment of tasty side dishes that make Peter Luger's menu look like the slip in a fortune cookie.
Theme and actors are kinda cool but you are charged some entertainment fee on top of the expensive food and drinks.
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
The waitress took forever to take our order, we waited almost an hour for our appetizers, and then she asked us whether she even put the order in -- as if we would even know.
Try the Duck Confit Hash (topped with two eggs) or the Beer Battered Fish Chips on the Brunch menu.
It still took a little while to get our drinks and food - But the atmosphere made up for it.
The Food This isn't for those on a budget, but portions are generous.
After our meal,the manager, even took some of his time to sit with us and give us a lesson in Sake 101.
The rest of the meal was good, but a little over priced for Chinese take out style food.
i mean the place was empty and it seemed to take for ever to get food, drink or the check.
Adding insult to injury, the waiter had to ask for the wine bottle by number (where are we?
The drinks were water down and the only BIG thing was the bill.
Flavorful Indian favorites like vegetable pakora, lamb tikka masala and tandoori chicken, as well as unexpected offerings such as Alaska king crab legs and fried coconut shrimp, are served at extremely reasonable prices.
The server was so busy the night we visited that she forgot to put in our food order.
Service was slow and our drink order took forever (and the place wasn't crowded).
The waiter was singing while taking our order- the food arrived 30 minutes later and the food was good, but the mules Frites were cold, the steak had to be returned twice-the spinach looked like it was grass from Union Square park with hunks of garlic in it-totally Unacceptable.
I asked the waitress what this was for and her responses were as follows: We put in an extra shot, We had to use ice in the drink, and It must have been the computer.
Prices are not cheap, but not expensive but the meal is worth every penny.
The service was not great, the wait staff were not clear on the ingredients and or preparation details of the meals.
The food here is consistently good - the service is not - but it seems that they're getting busier than they can handle, good for them, bad for guests.
The food is on the good side but not so terrific to compensate the bad service, crammed tiny-tables, dirty glasses, overly loud music, which is good for the bar part of the establishment but not when you want to seat down, eat and have a normal conversation at normal volume.
I sometimes go here when in the area and though the food is always great, the Basil Chicken and Shrimp Tempura roll in particular, the service has much to be desired.
I though the service could have been better, the staff are not experience enough to know how to make the drinks without reading the instructions.
I just had dinner there with my girlfriend and we had the best time.
the water guy was extremely attentive, thank god he was because we had to ask him for our waitress many times: for ordering our food, more drinks, dessert and check.
Amazing views of NYC regaled us at lunch earlier in the week and then at dinner this evening.
The waiter returned and said the bartender refused to take my drink back because there was nothing wrong with it and I would have to pay for it.
They ran out of the drinks my friends ordered, but the staff was eager-to-please and much appreciated.
Multiple televisions on both sides of the cozy room ensure unobstructed sight lines for fans, whether they're sipping pints at the oak bar or snacking on pub munchies--like baked clams, nachos, and buffalo wings--at tall tables in front.
Enjoy a drink at the bar over fresh shucked oysters.
Even with our large appetites we could not finish all the food or wine, which has never happened with a tasting menu before.
The sexy waiter suggested the Pineapple Basil ( I Know is sounds yucky, but MMMM) Martini.
It was well past 8 pm when they finally got us the check, and we asked for free rounds of champagne to compensate for the poor service (since the wine dinner had started, and were denied.
When the bill came, the waiter snatched it back so he could add the $3 difference to the wine.
The concoction was thrown away a mere two blocks from the Bar.
The bright point of dinner was dessrt.
A full bar and a dozen different margaritas attract a happy hour crowd, and a tortilla machine is often surrounded by children watching the dough-to-tortilla transformation.
Their appetizer portions are not huge, just right since the entrees are much larger.
Our server seemed out of it, and drinks took 15 minutes to arrive.
After I had complained to a bouncer (the manager would not see me) a waiter was sent over and did get us our drinks.
although I don't think there is any beef on the menu (but there is plenty of fish and chicken).
It has the most authentic Mexican found I have found in the Metro area and the margaritas are outstanding.
food arrived quickly and was hot and v good, just don't be on a diet if you are going to eat here as no real options for slimmers!!
) And don't forget the svc, those waiters stare at you your entire meal, just waiting for you to put your fork down and they snatch the plate away in a second.
True, the service is hardly on par with the finer restaurants in NYC, but I go for the energy and the tasty tapas-like seafood treats that are perfect with beer or sake.
The manager came over to our table at the end of our entree course to get our review.
I love the food, and have gone back several times, but each time the waitress is a little nastier.
The server rolled his eyes when we ordered only an entree per person (with no appetizers), spoke curtly to us, and ignored our requests for more water etc.
The wait for brunch is kinda long (what can you say?
The menu showcases Thai-French favorites: fresh chopped hai (white fish) and salmon with Chinese black olives and basil oil; mussels in coconut-lemon grass broth; and garlicky octopus sauteed with ground pork, broccoli rabe and lime juice.
My friends and I tried practically every strange, inventive dish on the menu, most of which are very tasty.
The wait staff while attentive did nothing to address the hair that was found in one of our dishes.
I understand its a very busy night of the week but it is unacceptable that I was hung up on by the hostess twice (I also called back and she refused to answer the phone for 15 minutes) and was told that I should have picked up my food instead of having it delivered.
Your drink is at your fingertips and you don't have to wait for the waitress to come back with your cocktail.
The Captain was showing his impatience for a crowded Monday night and the dinner I was served was not prepared the way he told me it would be.
Food was fine, and the place is pretty cool, but the waitstaff was slow and pretty clueless.
We ordered a platter that was an asssortment of appetizers which was great recomendation.
If you don't mind eating great thai food in a schnazzy ambience with a hop hip lunch crowd, then come on over to SPICE.
Beautiful rooms filled with beautiful people, but expensive for what it is ($68 prix fixe), limited menu, tiny portions, reeeeeeeally slow service, undercooked potatoes with the cod, less than fascinating desserts.
The owners Pat and John are very friendly and can often sit and have a beer with you.
It's not going to win any awards for its decor, but the food is good, the portions are big, and the prices are low.
It took an hour for us to order, another hour and 15 min to get our entree's I had to go to the bar to order my champange, and carry it back myself, the waiter got our entrees mixed up and placed them in the wrong place and sat there and watched me switch them around.
If you're tired of the long waits for table at nearby place, then head to Moutarde for a delicious meal that won't keep you waiting.
If you are undecided about which sandwich to choose, go for the Indecision, which is a trio of smaller sandwiches on the menu.
-4 waiters bustling around though no table was actually being helped -25 minutes to take our order -15 minutes to get the drinks we order -another 20 minutes to get our food -NO apology from the waiter In between our lunch, a man burst out shouting in anger at the lousy service (he asked for ketchup 20 minutes ago and never got it).
The food is ok, but not worth the prices.
not only did we not get our 'bombay' fries until after the entire meal, but we then had to wait nearly an hour for our inattentive waiter to bring our check, and only after we flagged him down.
1 hour for water, 1 hour for drinks, 1 hour for food, as you can see we were there for almost 5 hours before our bill came, not for enjoyment but pure frustration.
She walked away in a huff, and had the BUSBOY pass on the same message: you can't order coffee because you've already paid (have these people never heard of someone changing their mind?
Portions are small, they try to pass themselves off as family style by encouraging sharing and putting dishes in the center of the table, but it is glorified a la carte.
The Food The Korean dishes here are a bit more delicate than the potent fare found 30 blocks north, but the kitchen is hardly pulling its punches.
And the waitstaff has very little knowledge of the food, they served me the wrong dish and no one could identify what it was that they gave me, someone said pork chop, someone said lamb, and then they insisted it should be fine since it was the same price.
It appears to be a charming french outdoor bistro, and the food wasn't bad, but the waiters were clearly tired of dealing with tourists, and didn't handle us with care.
The wait staff was not as attentive as I would have liked, we had to ask several times for water and refills of water, and after the food was served, no one returned to check on us.
Basically the comfort is lacking but the food is the focus.
1) they gave us the wrong table had to wait 10 minutes until they gave us the one we wanted 2) had to wait 15 minutes for a waiter 3) ordered chicken and brocolli.
When the food came, it was almost good, but the lack of AC, bad service, and overall apathetic staff, from the HOST, to the MANAGER to the WAITER, ruined the experience.
The wine list was had some of my favorites which I have not seen anywhere in New York, and when I clumsily spilled both water and wine all of the my table the waitress and manager were there in a flash jovially helping me clear up the mess.
Service was a little slow, but going on a Monday night during the Brooklyn Restaurant Week, where 20 bucks each got a friend and I appetizer, entree, and dessert was phenomenal.
Not only did the food take an eternity to come out; but the waiter never checked in, explained the delay for the food, or refreshed our drinks.
The Scene Opened in 1993, Nick's may be the only great pizza place in the city of New York that isn't older than most of the people who eat there.
I was tempted to try the dessert because I've heard rave reviews about it, but we were stuffed, as the portions are fairly large.
We sat for 20-40min without water or bread and were basically ignored by the waitstaff.
Sure, the wait was a bit long for a table, but the service was good and the food was pretty good too.
Since the waiter NEVER checked on us during the meal, she never had the chance to ask for hoisin.
Nonetheless, our waiter gave us prompt service and a smile every time he came over to take an order, bring us drinks, or check up on how we were doing.
The owner circles the place asking patrons if their meals are fine.
small portions, average food 6) we ask for the check, the waiter says, ok, and 5 minutes later asks if we want coffee or dessert.
The food is average the prices high and the whole experience was very upsetting.
prices were low, you got a good deal, sushi was ok; everybody wins.
i went on a thurs night and it was a bit loud due to the many businessmen eating their dinner, but the food and service more than outdid the lack of peaceful dining.
They brought my mother a chicken enchiladas instead of cheese and then it took her 10 minutes to explain what the error was to the waiter and bus boy who then finally had to tell the manager who was also confused and my mother is fluent in Spanish.
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from.
My party did not love the meats on the menu maybe the pork dumplings but nothing else.
I absolutely hate communal seating and closely spaced tables and this place had both, but the atmosphere and the food were such that I was able to get beyond the grumpy mood that put me in to have a really good experience.
They need to change the overall decor if they want to get a serious dinner crowd though.
It would have been nice to find that out on the website but it took us an hour of waiting for Godot before calling and being told the news that no lunch was prepared for us.
Also, the waiter wrongly described a wine I had inquired about causing the sommelier to have to make a trip to the table to offer an alternate recommendation.
I love to go there on weekends and have the delicious french toast (made from baguette slices) or the granola with fresh fruit, sometimes I am so torn that I end up getting both!
i've been there for lunch - when the place is empty- and the waiter spent more time outside, soaking up the sun for himself, like he was a patron.
The atmosphere is still to die for, but the wine list has so clearly been pared down and marked up (as a result of higher foot traffic brought in by lots of rave reviews in local publications, perhaps?
Last, but not least, when we walked in, most of the clientelle was Vietnamese and next to us was a food critic whose review was on the back of the menu.
Excellent Steaks, the attitude of the Servers could be a little better but the food makes up for everything.
The pooris were miniscule, about 2 bites each; they serve 4 of those as a dinner for $25!
Oh, the prices were not so bad either, we paid $58 for chicken, salmon, one sushi roll, one ceasar salad and soda :).
) The food was good, but not at all worth the price.
The music is a little bit louder, but the food is excellent.
It's sad that everything about this place was great (even the service and decor) except for the steak.
The Food It's a people-pleasing menu, with spaghetti and meatballs, calamari, eggplant Parmesan and other red-sauce classics alongside several more upscale dishes.
Service was bad enough that we decided to head out after the first round of drinks.
The waitress told us the portions were not big, so we each got an entree and shared a side.
The mole sauce is not too sweet and adds a nice flavor to the otherwise bland chicken.
very nice servers, but they seemed more interested in conversing with the regulars than bringing food and being attentive.
Food was good but portions were quite tiny.
We were charged for the missing appetizer and when I complained to the manager, who never thought to apologize, he blamed the kitchen.
One of the waitstaff spilled a huge drink on the floor that splattered everyone nearby, no offering of apology was made or to foot the drycleaning bill and no comp was offered either.
went here w/ great expectations and was greatly disappointed; the food was good, not great and vastly overpriced- one salad, two pasta dishes, two demi-carafes of red wine- $100 (tax and tip); rediculous; orechiette came w/ so little brocoli rape that it did not have its characteristic flavor; and it is very very loud.
Between the seven of us we sampled just about everything on the menu, and nothing disappointed (ribs pulled pork seemed like the biggest hits).
The salads were amazing in themselves - mixed greens andtomato wedges in a delicious balsamic vinagrette with slices of Italian bread with warm goat cheese.
Two Tom's food is excellent, it more than makes up for the lack of decor.
If you are looking for service and all the frills $$$ - Il Mulino is the best for both - if you are looking for a fabulous dinner in/out - this restaurant is it!
Unfortunately for them, we would have ordered twice as many drinks if we didn't have to wait half an hour for the waitress between every drink.
I made the mistake of coming here with 5 friends for brunch so the wait was extremely long and then we got stuck at the only table big enough for 6 (downstairs near the bathroom away from all of the other patrons) so that was dissapointing but I will be back soon with 1 or 2 friends.
Our waiter told us he knew all the wines on it quite well, and he did!
This newly opened restaurant is another one of those Indian places that has a hugely promising menu and a greatly disappointing food.
Yes, this place is good, a cut above some of the other local diner food and a nice, friendly atmosphere.
If you're looking for barbeque like Dallas BBQ (soaked in sauce from a bottle, generic, homogeneous food) then you won't like Blue Smoke.
For the price I paid for a cup of Bustelo coffee w/ milk I could buy 2 vacumed packs for 3 bucks.
Three course meal for lunch was $13, the prices for dinner were just as great!
Lost reservations, out of liquor, jam-packed, waiting room, out of wine, sent steak out raw, no choices for dessert, no room to breathe, terrible service, etc.
The Food The menu includes lovingly made renditions of panini, bruschetta and tramezzini (cocktail-style sandwiches with fillings like tuna with black olive pesto and bresaola with arugula), along with a roster of cured meats, cheeses and olives that have been imported from Italy.
My meal here was awesome, the appetizers, the bar finger food, the service, the drinks, the entrees of Smoked fish, Lamb salad, Clay pot salmon, Lobster rolls, and the dining room is spectacular.
The place is small, but loaded with plenty of goodies that range from Italian inspired treats to Greek pastries all well prepared.
The pizza is thet always fresh and just made they hav an outdoor seating area that is partially covered they also have a full service restaurant on the premises they make everything on premises.
A friend was dieing for chorizo but it was only in the tapas menu which we couldn't have.
They had a prix fixe menu with the most amazing cooked quail appetizer, then lobster bisque, followed by a divine choice of entree, and then the chocolate mousse dessert.
In summer, the small outdoor garden is an ideal place to sip coffee while reading under a canopy of trees and sky.
not having a menu was rather strange at first but the food was superb.
Casual and kid-friendly, the red-and-gold colored restaurants offer quick drive-thru or dine-in service with a menu of burgers, sandwiches and more.
dining with my mother this past Saturday must have signaled to the wait staff that I wasn't cool enough to merit their attention.
Overall, the food makes up for what is missing in the ambience and service.
FINALLY the waitress came with our food after an HOUR!
Before our server took our drink order she told us that the prices on the menu were going to be higher that night because of the party.
After arguing about this and requesting tap water instead of a bottled variety, we were exiled to customer Siberia, and the staff seemed eager get us out of the restaurant as soon as possible.
Instead of being smart business people and treating us as paying customers, we were told they do not serve drinks, only food (only food?
However the casual atmosphere comes in handy if you want a good place to drop in and get food.
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.
We were ignored by our waitress after our entrees had been served.
My greek salad cost about $9 and for that price, I would not have expected chopped olive (as opposed to whole), and shredded bits of lettuce.
The retaurant is know for the long wait but they do take reservation for group of 5-8 people, so it was just perfect for my friend BD dinner for 3 couples.
since we're informed its service isslow we had dinner in midtownwent for dessertb-day thing.
the soups were superb and only $2 a bowl, and the entire dinner, with beers, cost less than $30 for two people.
The place was practically empty when my friends and I got there for dinner.
Desserts were visually inventive but lacking in flavor.
The place was packed and while our food took time to be prepared, our waiter earned points for his sparkling conversation to pass time and for also knowing practically every ingredient of every special under consideration.
i recently had brunch at the new hill diner let me tell you it was great.
The festive crew serves from a gigantic menu of American classics: chili, burgers, cobb salads, baked potatoes, wings, philly cheesesteaks, club sandwiches, you name it.
The head-on shrimps with anchovy butter had me licking the plate.
You can only sit on the stools with a slice, as the main dining area downstairs is for real food.
The wine list didn't look all that great, but there was a very interesting selection of beers on tap.
Unfortunately the food and the service don't live up to the spectacular setting.
The food was OK, but trying to get anything, like a drink refill or the check, was an ordeal, and this was when the place was nearly empty!
Seating is limited, so you will probably want to order take-out, but a better take-out pizza you will not find!
The clientel, however, make it a scene for creative, talented people--inlcuding a soon-to-be-famous theater director who used to waitress there!
I liked the overall setting A LOT and it was only improved by the fact that our waiter was pleasant and attentive even though we only ordered entrees (no drinks, no appetizers, no coffee).
However service was quite slow for a lunch hour.
The menu was much too narrow - 4 pastas and 6 meat dishes or so.
We only saw 2 - 3 boring appitizers on the menu and not a lot of choices of meat to select from.
The service may be a little slow (what can you expect in this laid back atmosphere), but a Sunday brunch is a rewarding experience.
Get in before peak dinner time (7-8 PM) to avoid harried service.
The mussels and frits were great, but the host had an attitude and my friends and I waited about 1 1/2 hours to be seated on a random Tues.
My date knew the waiters from years of dining here, so we were treated like royalty.
While the appetizers I sampled (gnocchi; shrimp wrapped in coconut or somesuch) were not so impressive (the gnocchi portion is meager and overpriced), my table was 100% satisfied with their entrees too.
The bill came out to quite a lot though, considering there were 14 of us some of us ordered way too many drinks.
Many Thais top off spicy dishes with a fried egg, but in many places it's not on the menu and when requested, I will either get charged $1.
It had not been made fresh at the bar, but kept in the freezer till we ordered, they also forgot our soup, kept us waiting for the frozen sushi for close to an hour.
The owners couldn't have been more accomodating -- we had the entire restaurant to ourselves on a Saturday (before it opens to the public for dinner).
We would have left and gone to another restaurant but the host kept saying that a table was opening up in 5 minutes, people had just paid, etc - except when I went to check the table, they were ordering dessert.
Our waiter was pushing us all night to take our plates, and swiped my dessert before I was finised with it.
Food was good, but not worth the wait.
Didn't like having to flag down waiters for drinks, nor having to wait almost 15 minutes for a check after asking two servers.
I don't usually go there over the weekends or during prime dinner hours--but for a weekday dinner it's great, and I've never had any problems with crowds, waiting, or bad service.
A+ for the food but the wait staffs need to educate themselves better.
The food was awful and took forever to arrive - which considering the limited menu, few diners and the fact that we ordered chili, mac cheese and a grill cheese was annoying.
Finally got our food after waiting a long time for oysters, doesn't take that long to shuck 'em, the place isn't that big, and it was OK.
I also asked for a chef (thought that may be able to talk about the food for the party), but the waitress said that there was no chef at the restaurant.
Our waiter (who also seemed to be the manager) dropped red wine all over me the contents of my purse and all he did was apologize quickly, hand me some club soda and avoid me for the rest of the time I was there.
Dining experience begins with cracked, filthy vinyl tile flooring tables so small close together that you couldn't move.
*Food:Just about anything on the menu, however the sandwhiches are most popular and recommended.
To be fair, I realize I was there for lunch and that the food is probbably better at dinner service when a full kitchen staff has arrived and prepped, but I doubt I'd return to find out with so many other options in the neighborhood i already trust.
Food and Service of the same high quality elsewhere in NY would have been twice the cost.
Silky black bass with porcini mushrooms carries smoky, earthy and buttery overtones that somehow never overpower the fish, and whole-roasted baby pig includes belly meat, braised for 24 hours in five spice-ginger glaze, and yet the pork flavor is still fully present.
Overall,it's a good place to have dinner and hang out if you do not mind waiting for food,weird music and rude manager.
Went there for dinner last night w/ my boyfriend and a friend after work and got there around 7 so we were able to score seats in this tiny cramped space.
The chips and salsa are good, but the meal is not worth the wait.
The chefs and staff are welcoming and happy to make substitutions or tune the spice up or down to your requests.
The wait could be long because of the limited number of seats but it is worth it, especially if you leave your cell phone # with them and go off for a drink at any one fo the excellent bars nearby, like lokie, great lake, etc.
The food took forever to come out from the kitchen.
The meal arrived just as we were finishing the appetizers, each good portions.
Aperitif was the Casablanca; it was served carelessly with ice chunks large enough to sink the Titanic.
The inattentive waiters never refilled our water glasses, never offered more drinks, our silverware was never replaced, and it took almost half an hour at times for them to clear our table after we finished a course.
The choices on the menu were very limited-discounting raw items, there were practically no appetizers The foie gras de canard was mediocre with a syrupy sauce.
The Food The restaurant boasts an impressive raw bar and samplings from the bait menu a big draw.
In the hour we waited for our food we had to remind our mentally challenged waitress 3times to bring our chipssalsa.
They did a great job on the decor but it seems that the food has gotten a bit less in the quality department, as well as in the portion size!
the service was somewhat spotty, but we were rewarded with free drinks and the waiters were all sweet and lovely, genuinely french-speaking but not snooty!
The irony of it all is that I tried the fish and chips at a sports bar across the street the following week, 1/2 the price (w/ fries included), and the portion was bigger and much tastier.
The spaghetti with ricotta cheese is hands down my favorite thing on the menu and I am big fan of the house wine.
) I also noticed the table next to ours didn't enjoy her dish and they went above and beyond to try to make up for it.
The ambience is cool, and the cocktails might be worth coming by, but head somewhere else for dinner.
After sitting without any beverages for about fifteen minutes, the manager got up and poured a glass of water for his smacking companion.
PDiddy need a new staff you would have thought it was a bunch of old people cooking the food and waiting on us.
No extra pickles, no AC, no ice water, slow service, the whole thing was just dissapointing.
Dishes feature intriguing names, and interesting combinations of fresh ingredients.
The servers, casual in their striped button-downs, anticipate and fulfill needs as if they were trained as mind readers.
Fortunately the hostess was nice enough to take our appetizers off the bill after we complained.
What it lacks in decor it more than makes up in the cuisine.
It was not the mistake of the frozen lasagna, it was the icy service of the manager which has spoiled this restaurant for me.
Since it changed owners/chefs, the portions are smaller (I always used to ask for a doggie bag for my chic-parm), now I can finish and still be hungry even after appetizers (which aren't as good anymore).
I was their for Saturday lunch, adn I think that there's a different dinner menu, but everything was great.
Greek Glasswine is still on menu along side good value bottle selections fromaround the world.
Though we had to wait about 45 minutes from our dinner reservation time, we were given breadsticks, olives and parmasean to nibble on while we waited, albeit in the very cramped bar area.
The manager (or someone very important that was able to be seated 1/2 hour before opening) sat in the corner, with a glass of wine, a date, and talked on his cell for about an hour, loudly, while the first arrivals were sent to the hotel tearoom next door.
We had to ask for bread after 45 minutes and even though our waiter was GREAT, he had to ask the stiff manager to comp us a round of drinks for waiting so long.
They offer a sushi bar with very fresh fish, and the side dishes are excellent.
you go all out with dress, tastes, and performance, and in the end its really about having a good time where you truly indulge yoursef in good vodka, compnay, music, and food.
There's even a nice menu of savory items served during late lunch and dinner hours.
The only reason they seem to taste so good is because the food is well decorated with its super small portion.
The wait time for food can be long, so don't dine here if you're in a hurry.

I live around the corner and I miss the unpretentious and always lovely, Irving on Irving, that used to occupy this space where you didn't need a reservation three weeks in advance to eat dinner after 5:30 and before 11 pm.
The waitress did try to get the manager to at least give us the Sangria on the house but the manager refused.
One friend's pizza arrived about 15 minutes before the rest of our meals (the remainder of our entrees did not even arrive at the same time), and our waiter half-heartedly apologized for the delay while rolling his eyes.

The Food This Cajun-Italian menu is lengthier than its Manhattan counterparts--here, adventuresome diners can still design their own pies, but they can also feast on oversized plates of peel-and-eat old bay shrimp and cajun spaghetti with meatballs enlivened with andouille sausage.

' When I called the waitress on it, she said that they simply couldn't serve tap water.
With all of the kitchen goof-ups (appetizer coming out before the entree and one entree coming out ten minutes before the other) you would think that the wait staff would have been more attentive.
The decor was mediocre and honestly, I can get a better brunch at a Cracker Barrel restaurant.
We initially ordered a bottle of wine and the waitress though we may not like it, so she offered us a taste.

The cajun food is great but there is something for everyone on the menu and I have yet to be disappointed.
The staff was accomodating towards our daughter and nice enough to check up on her after they served dinner (I was a little concerned about the spices and they suggested a dish).

When my group complained to our waiter about a cake cutting fee that involved no cutting, the manager came over to the table and basically told us that it was our fault for not knowing that their policy was just to serve the plates, not to cut.

Sushi is consistently fresh, service pleasant Sushi rice is a bit hard.
One example, I ordered an appetizer that was not prepared as the menu stated and had to argue with waitress to get it fixed.
We ask the waiter where's the chocolate?
Usually you lose food quality the trendier you go, but not at this place.
The food was good but not worth the price.
It is not a very stylish place, but we had some of the best Chinese food we ever had.
Aged beef charred on the outside, red on the inside.
A cute restaurant and average food (with a small menu).
The waiter never came by to check on us after the bus boy brought us our food.
The waitstaff is nice, but is pushy and seemed irritated when we did not order an a la carte side vegetable (we already had a cheese plate, appetizers and ordered 2 entrees).
Our waiter took our drink orders and never came back!
After a show we had surperb steaks and had cocktails at the bar.
The menu was small, but the food delicious.
Later in the evening after our meal we finally found the real owner behind the bar of the restaurant and explained to him the situation which he had been made aware of by the waitress.
The bar was so crowded there was no point in ordering a drink, and when we were finally seated we got no service at all for 20 minutes.
It's really great to go in here and be able to get a creative cheap drink (they have things like blueberry mohitos for $4), a $4 plate of veggie spring rolls, and be able to joke with the bartender.
We started with some drinks on the front porch and then continued at our table with a bottle of delicious red wine.
They need to expand the menu some, and offer additional toppings for the pizza.
Its two massive rooms are frequented predominantly by Greeks who chow down on traditional mezze--spinach pie, feta cheese and stuffed grape leaves--and entrees--kebabs, sandwiches and pasta dishes.
(They even let us bring our own cake for the event, which many restaurants may not allow you too) They food was good as I only sampled so I can't really comment.
I asked the waiter about the vintages of the wines, to which he replied, I don't know, probably 2003/2004.
The filet was NOT on the menu, but my friend had the bouillabaisse, which he found delicious.
We tried explaining nicely to them that we were just finishing up a drink, and after a brief, unprofessional discussion with the two waiters, they told us never to come back again.
The desserts were both essentially the same, and the service was on the slow side.
Tried it again for brunch, when the service was worse.
The manager sent us a complimentary glass of wine for the steak not being cooked like he wanted.
It is expensice, but the portions are big and include a side, salad, nan and rice along with your main meal!
We explained that we had left a standard 15% on food, and a slightly smaller percentage on alcohol (At least 10%).
If it's atmosphere you want go to the River Cafe under the bridges and pay an arm and a leg for hospital-type food.
The menu is limited so I opted for the jalapeno potato soup and a romaine salad.
My friend was looking forward to her favorite dish on the menu had made reservations for the 14 of us a few weeks beforehand.
It's cheesy, great herbs,good bread and large slices But it's in a very dirty area, good for take out and bring it home kind of place.
The downside is that perhaps due to rice's eclectic nature, the chef has trouble cooking any single type to perfection.
The steak is brought to the table soaked in grease.
17 for a small cup of tea.
the kimchi and other sides were off, the rice had red bean mixed in, and the waitress gave us a double order of the bulgogi instead of two single orders of different meats.
After being seated took our waiter 10 mintues to get us a menu, 15 minutes to come back for our order, by the time we finally got our food it was almost 1 1/2 hour since getting there.
After waiting forty minutes for our brunch, learned that the waitress had -- oops!
Teenie weenie overpriced appetizers were served at an agonizingly slow pace, one at a time 30 minutes between each.
), but our waiter was had a horrible attitude, couldn't remember to bring lemon for our water, or soy sauce for our sushi rolls, the food was wonderful, but unfortunately the service ruined our visit.
I have never tried anything else on the menu the burgers are so good.
I had one of the worst service experiences in memory having the prix fix brunch there--waving arms, calling, asking two or three times for everything from coffee to the check.
We wouldn't bother quibbling over the price of a few drinks anyway but I wonder why they would offer if they weren't intending to back it up.
The service sucks every time, but the food is usually tasty, even though the menu leans toward the boring and expected of French fare.
Then, we discovered that not ordering guacamole for your table is tantamount to asking the wait staff to roll their eyes at you and then ignore you during your entire meal (I had to eventually go to the front of the restaurant to ask for our check).
The wait staff were incredibly attentive, though as a warning, if you like wine, but also a little privacy, this might not be a good idea, since they have the tendency to hover a bit.
The service was average - the waiter did not check in on our meals and did not even refill the water, but was a bit pushy on desert (we both ordered schnapps).
For appetizers, wine, dinner, desert, great convesation, expect to spend a couple of hours.
They crumbed the table once, although it was solied the entire meal.
Service is wonderful- I've sat there for over 3 hours at dinner and never felt rushed to leave.
The waitress was not very responsive to requests and was slow to return with drinks.
The seafood is out of this world and priced accordingly.
Most of the food has a vinegary flavor (I think because of the injera).
One of the managers offered us a seat at the bar to wait for a table, there we had the most amazing empanadas and red sangria.
The waiter ignored us for ten minutes, the restaurant was empty, got our drink orders wrong, got one main dish order wrong and the disappeared for another ten minutes before we could get the check.
While the design of the space and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable (with a great view of Union Square), the food has once again proved to be less than favorable and the service mediocre.
I think they just tried to get a little too creative with the menu and actually ended up losing flavor in some of the dishes.
The restaurant didn't mind me sitting on their doorstep to the extent that the bartender invited me in for a drink.
That said, I made sure to pay before we had coffee, so that the server was not waiting on us to pay; and I left a 30% tip, knowing we'd be there for a while.
The sevice and food were excelent, but at the bottom of the menu were the words, cash only.
When the hostess finally appears she tells me that she can't seat us on the mostly empty patio because all the open tables are for dinner not drinks.
The menu, fortunately, matches the other locations, covering the basics of Ethiopian cooking, and includes sambosas, kifto (chopped beef often served raw), tibs (lamb sauteed with rosemary), and, of course, injera, the spongy bread that doubles as a utensil.
If going for lunch, best to go by 12:30, even if getting take-out, the place is tiny and fills up quickly, both with people eating there, and standing waiting for take-out orders.
In retrospect, that was kind of foolish, as the portions for dinner were obscene.
All in all, it was a decent meal but dinner for two came to $172 with tip.
The scene is reasonably cool but unworth more than a drink.
had dinner there last night, max the waiter was great.
I was really excited when our waiter read off the list of specials.
05 bar of melted chocolate in a cup.
Even without this hiccup, the service seemed very amateur--not snooty, as I've read in other reviews--just nowhere near as good as it should be given the price of the meal.
Management had always been rude, but without the great staff as a buffer, Jesse's is just another pubby place with poor decor and average food.
The menu holds no letdowns: Desserts, like a cone of stiff kulfi with licorice, ot cinnamon souffle, extend dinner's spice into the sweet realm.
We were a large party, over 6 people, and after our initial drinks, which included a couple bottles of wine, and order were taken we did not see a waiter or a busboy again for over an hour!!
The Food Diners are prompted to order several shareable dishes which, considering the food isn't what's drawing most of the crowd, are surprisingly good.
Having just returned from Bourbon Street, I thought I had experienced the steepest drink prices in the US, but this is worse than N'awlins, where at least the expensive drinks cover wonderful live music.
Everything on the menu is satisfyingly savory, from a simple pot of mussels in a choice of sauces (beer-and-bacon, creamy mushroom, or white-wine-and-garlic broth), to beef stewed with beer and prunes, to a juicy croque-monsieur, and beyond.
We approached the host and manager politely after the meal but only received a simple and insincere Sorry.
The execution in the dining room was on point and we never had any service or food issues.
We were left waiting a while after our food for our waiter to return, and thus we did not have time for dessert.
Again in a group 6 months ago, the service was even worse this time, practically begging for water and other drinks while we waited an age just to get our orders taken.
FOOD WAS OK,SERVICE NOT SO OK,WAITED FOR THE CHECK WHILE OUR WAITER WAS GOSSIPPING,WAITED FOR CHANGE,WHILE OUR WAITER WAS GOSSIPPING.
The food at Mercer Kitchen is great, flavorful and nicely portioned.
The server seemed drunk, he forgot mixed up our food with some other table, ignored our requests for more water, drinks etc.
Tiny slices of pie with a dribble of cream topped off the evening.
There is no service at this bar, which means no drinks or food -- ultimately leading to a very frustrating night out, and you end up kicking yourself for not leaving an hour earlier.
The Scene The bruising thoroughfare that is East 57th Street is the last place you'd expect to find an intimate, adorably decorated Northern Italian spot where it's actually possible to have a quiet, pleasant dinner.
i love this pizza, its not greasy or filled with mounds of cheese, its just fresh tomatoes basil and buffalo mozz.
This place is even good for just drinks after work (nice bar) I am going back there as soon as I get a chance.
Desserts were pleasent enough, if not trying way to hard on presentation, lacking portions and interest.
Although the food what adequate, the service was preposterous.
Our waiter, even though he was serving dinner, was SO out to lunch.
The Scene There are two distinct personalities to the place: The loud, seemingly always-crowded bar with hanging paper decorations and dim lighting, and the two main dining areas, where the noise level and decor is notably more subdued.
Food again was not just a name on the menu but very well made and fresh.
I let the waiter know and he offered me a free dessert.
But it's the ambience that is the draw for me---sipping red wine and sitting under the red awning on a warm night.
Customers choose flavors like sweet cream, cake batter or banana, add mix-ins--ranging from candy bar chunks and Gummi bears to hot fudge and peanut butter--then servers mash it all together on a frozen slab of granite.
So, if you don't care about speedy service, go; but if you aren't in the habit of lighting your cigarette with twenties, avoid the tapas.
Our server spilled a drink on the table cloth and it was cleaned up in an instant, no mess, free drinks to compensate, and left us impressed at how seamlessly this was fixed.
The food is consistantly great, but the wait is often long and the noise is often deafening.
If you want to avoid the long lines, arrive at 5:00 PM and have an early dinner.
We were seated fastly enough, and ordering was painless, but I got the wrong appetizer, we both received the same item instead.
I agree with the many posters addressing an oppressively aggressive waitstaff, and I'm in particular support of the review directed at Franny's bizarrely adamant refusal to cut pizza (or provide adaquate knives/plates for us to do it ourselves).
finally they wanted to take our app order before taking our wine order, seemed like the waiter couldnt handle it all at once.
Nonetheless, it's an excellent pie -- and don't let the long lines scare you off -- they keep them moving.
Across the menu, and even within a single dish, there is a stunning variety of scintillating, distinct flavors.
They may love the wacky/tacky decore, the overly gracious host, Gus, and his staff, the loads of freebies (oranges, cookies, lollies and wet naps), but the food is just mediocre.
probably not worth the wait on the weekend when pomodoro is a block away but worth getting for delivery if you are in the area or for dinner during the week.
The margaritas were mediocre, but it did not make up for the muzak they played in the resturant nor the bad food and drink they served.
The food as always was fantastic, and the pricing was moderate although I was not happy about the 18% gratuity being added for parties over 6, especially after the horrible service we recieved.
sushi portions were bigger than most places and service was average, far better options available in the area.
I always thought the food was decent, but not spectacular and the price fair, but no bargain.
the waitress was not attentive at all and we had to keep getting the attention of the water servers to get more drinks.
Its the perfect place to take a date, start out with dinner and then stick around for dancing!
When we went up to get what we assumed would be our second drink at no charge, the bartender charged us $5 a piece.
We saw problems with our waitress immediately when she frowned when we opted for tap water instead of bottled.
Waiter was very arrogant, though tha staff was attentive and when a waiter pilled a glass of water on one of our guests, the hostess ran with a dry cleaning voucher even though we did not make a big deak of it - just an accident and only water.
For the money, it's a dependable and fun place to get sushi - bring friends and share the 2 for 1 rolls (they have to be 2 of the same.
The service was lacking a bit, we waited about 20 mins for a waiter and water to come to us once we were sat and we had to ask for everything twice, even drink orders - I think maybe we just got stuck with a bad waiter though.
When I asked the manager to remove the coffee, she did so without question, but never asked why and never followed up on the issue (she was far too busy flirting with the male waiters).
We both orderd drinks that we never recived, but were charged for, and when we said something to the waiter he rolled his eyes and asked if we wanted them anyway (after we were done eating and more than ready to go.
waiters were very nice, they dont take reservations during the week end, we waited at the bar with some sangria, Very good experience, loud music but we were able to communicate easily, overall i recommand this place to groups and dates,   Will be back more often!
I would not suggest dining here unless you get a different server.
After having the table cleared and recieving fresh warm plates, we shared the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chicken and Lentils.
I will say that often times they make their drinks very strong (may tell your bartender / waitress to keep it mild).
The food is worth going for, but the boys in behind the bar in the lounge are what keep me coming back!
The server spilled beer on the table when he poured it; he dropped ice cubes for another one of our guests and water everywhere else.
The only downside was the service was slow and our waitress kept forgetting to bring our drinks.
too bad that the 2 sushi chefs have become a bit too busy to chat away with the guests at the counter, but they try and hey, we are here for the food !!!
) I'm sticking with Cafe Mozart--which has the same desserts, bigger slices, and lower prices!
There is a litte bit of a wait on the food, but it is well worth it!
The second time we went the waiter didn't put in our pizza order!
We showed up and waited 30 minutes in line 30 minutes to get our drinks -after we asked twice, the service was the worst I've had in nyc.
I tried almost everything on the menu, but my fav is the pumkin raviloi, too bad it's only seasonal.
It was more than enough food even though the portions are tiny.
The bill came out to like $100pp, and noone touched their food, and drinks were left untouched because after the first bite/sip you want to never touch it again.
The ensuing dinner was definitely worth the wait; I'll be dreaming about chef Jodi Williams' extraordinary fried squash blossoms for a long time.
Beers on tap were pretty good and we had a great waiter but the food left much to be desired.
I think that argentine cuisine can be match more interesting better that the insipid expirience that I had in this overpriced place.
DINERS serve better french toast than Balthazar.
The hummus was not flavorful and when we ran out of bread and asked for more, it never came.
That's almost enough to prove its legitimacy to me, but eating there, both for a quick slice and sit-down for pasta with my family has always been a delicious, inexpensive and fun experience.
I love the decor but would not recommend sitting in the communal tables unless its a very big group, much more fun getting a table and people watch while you chomp on your $20 palm sized truffle pizza.
Then another pleasant surprise - the menu said we had to share the entree for each couple.
I can't imagine how small the fish portion on the $10 lunch menu must be if I got the large one.
The Food  Most restaurants with more than 250 items on the regular menu don't do any of them particularly well.
It's too loud and the cheesiest music is played throughout the meal.
Yellowtail tuna carpaccio, lightly dressed with a hint of mint, sings of summer, and crab salad partnered with sweet-hot mango mustard and greens hits all the right flavor notes.
The menu alternates between typical American fare (salads, potato skins, Angus burgers and grilled chicken) and modestly international cuisine like fajitas, wraps and pot stickers.
The pro's: Good ambience,service The Con's: For the 4 to 5 star price (200 dollars for 2 people which included 2 drinks each, an appetizer, main course, and a hsared dessert), the food and presentation was just average.
my one complaint is that when we were finished with our dinner, it took an abnormally long time for our waitress to get with the program and bring us our check.
The service was average and the tables are really close together (but who cares when the food is this good).
In Short This restaurant, an offshoot of the celebrity-besieged East Hampton eatery of the same name, is enlivened by a copper-topped bar, an on-display wood-burning oven and a royal blue oceanic mural running along its walls.
My friend was a vegetarian and the staff went out of their way to provide her with a special entree.
They ended up cramming 10 of us on 3 small tables, then taking forever with our food.
For dessert we split the combination platter, which had rather small portions but they were good.
Service was not snooty and you'll be treated the same whether you order one of the $150+ kaiseki dinners or a single entree.
Unfortunately, that lunch can take a loooooong time as the waiters seem to forget food orders, forget drink orders, and forget to refill water glasses.
Ordered a beer from the bartender, she opened it and the told me that she didn't know the price !!
The Food Recalling an era of calorie-defying decadence--hard liquor, red meat, cigars and mammoth portions--gluttony is the operative word here.
Personally, I like my food fresh, so you just have to tell the waiter that you would like to order by ear.
The tasting menu experience lasted close to three hours and included six or seven food courses and three desert courses.
My partner had ordered an appetizer that was no longer available; the waitress did not inform us when reviewing the specials.
i went here on a whim and found out you could get sushi for half price kind of like happy hour.
It's called OYSTER BAR, and yet no oyster selection at all!
They kept the chef, margarita machines, and practically the identical menu from Miracle Grill (the restaurant that formerly had the space); how is it that everything here is so much worse?
The menu was filled with of course the standard sushi fair, but the real gem was the unuusal and creative combinations of sushis and sauces and other ingredients they had as well.
Not the most adventurous nor exquisite food, but generous portions (at least, on the 3-course prix fixe) that were faultlessly executed, complemented by a varied wine list ranging from that special bottle for a celebratory splurge to excellent choices under $50.
The only redeeming factor of the night was the dessert which was very good but certainly not worth the cost of an overall horible experience.
If your friends persuade you to check this place out, I suggest that you order all of your drinks, apps, entrees, desserts, and the check up front, because you'll never see your server again.
So are cooked plates: Marinated Kobe beef practically melts on its skewers, soy-buttered scallops collapse with sweet brine and Chawanmushi custard, quivering in eel-soy broth with black truffles and foie gras, is over the top.
I've been here twice for brunch, and I found the ambience and food to be much better than the overly-hyped Kitchenette next door.
Not the ideal spot when you're really hungry -- the plates are tiny and the prices not (like every other upscale tapas place).
The Scene Tucked away on the second floor of a small, nondescript Madison Avenue building, Caviar Russe feels more like a private club than a restaurant.
While the server offered nothing, the host apologized, and said that he hoped that I would return again, perhaps for brunch.
I noticed many of the other comments had negative things to say about the service and food - my thoughts and suggestions are: eat at the bar to avoid a rude waiter or bad service here and Artisanal's reputation is based on the cheese, get the CHEESE and not the steak or whatever.
Our waitress was very nice, not snotty - she even gave us a free apertif after the meal (and left the bottle on the table).
The prices seemed reasonable with entrees ranging from $14-$25.
What I liked the most is that the staff listened attentively to what I asked for and my meal was prepared EXACTLY the way I asked, what a treat.
the prices are right and i strongly recommend this place for any time of day: early breakfast or late night snack.
Also, if you order a dinner, plan to have leftovers for the next day because the portions are HUGE, the salad that comes with a meal is large enough to be a meal itself.
-the bread served was cold  -the choices for restaurant week was very slim (no meat dish except pork) -there were no chef's treats or delights -the food was ok but not up to the quality expected There are more exciting, romantic restaurants in the city to visit.
Lovely place with the kind of Chinese food I like -- clean presentation, sizeable menu, and a bit of a French twist.
Our waiter showed up two minutes later to take our order and showed up with our drinks 25 minutes later and they were not crowed.
Food is decent but portions are so tiny and the whole meal is served on huge plate which makes it look even more ridiculous.
I am an extremely low maintenance diner and the staff at this restaurant managed to insult my dinner party and refuse kitchen service minutes after seating us and informing us that the kitchen was open.
The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal.
When after 2 hours we did ask for our entrees, the waiter and busboy were both extremely rude.
He did do the service part well enough -- brought the food, etc.
it is too bad because the food, ambiance, and drinks were great but they need serious help on the service.
Hey - What better excuse to sit at the bar and try another one of their fantastic drinks.
Come in the evening, sip a glass of wine, or two, and enjoy the great live jazz along with your dinner.
Hunan Delight has one page in their menu full of Vegetarian dishes.
Starting off with an excellent carafe of Cotes du rhone suggested by the waiter, we soon ordered a few appetizers like the steak tartare, the escargot and the goat cheese tart.
After they were done poking and prodding our food, the waiter took it right from their table and tried to give it to us.
Don't go for the decor or the location, go for the food!
We waited forever for our orders, our drinks came out AFTER our food, we never got refills on water, we had to ask like three times for extra dressing, and our waiter was rude.
The service was very rushed and as we were finishing our drinks and paying our bill, the owner asked us to leave so he could seat other people at our table.
Our waiter was great and we even got drinks and some food courtesy of the cheff- maybe because it wasn't so busy when we went.
Oh, you should have seen the look on the waiter's face when we told him we didn't want any coffee after the meal.
All the dishes that we had at our table were consistently good, although not great (nor poor, either).
Delivery portions are bigger and 2 can easily share 1 entree.
No specials and no crab limited the menu choices, and the toast for my (very average) foie gras arrived 5 minutes after the rest of the food, and was cold and burnt.
If I went back, I'd have dinner in the bar--better service and even better atmosphere.
We felt the waiter and captain rushed us through our meal.
The worst occasion, and the final straw for me was when myself and four friends were told that we could have a table if we moved away from our stools at the bar.
Servers are layed back, but food arrives rapidly.
Wine has had C-Tails at the bar(SUPRISE!!!)
I went there for lunch a couple of times but whenever I went there (even though we pinpointed our order on menu), waitress messed up our order and they never said sorry.
Xunta's tapas dishes were great though a little pricey for small plates.
Their Billy-Cheese steak sandwich is very good, too, but last I was there it wasn't on the menu, at least not for dinner anyway.
We had the tasting menu -- which was not a meal!!!
We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off.
We sat soaked in red wine for 20 minutes eating our meals w/o the wine b/c the server saw us like that but did nothing until we stopped him.
I've eaten at this Zen Palate location a few times, and each time have had the same reaction- I feel the food's sub-par, but decide to give it another chance and order something else.
Diners at the bar watch busy chefs scoop lobster salad onto warm brioche rolls.
The food and appearance of Alfama is quite nice but the menu is a bit deceptive in that my grilled shrimp (Peri Peri) consisted of an entree plate with three shrimp, no veggies or starch.
My vegetable Napoleon was good; although i first got the veggie burger because the waitress mis-heard and stood my friend up for another 15 minutes of waiting to have it served.
Went with a large group of 7 ladies before a show, and the staff was extremely obliging, even when one person was late and we had to wrap up her dinner to take to her.
Our waitress left halfway through dinner, without explanation, and was replaced by another waiter.
Service during either brunch or dinner could be quicker and more attentive at times.
You can undoubtedly get better food and service for the price at other places, but certainly not with those views!
Other than its impossible reservation (no matter how many months you call in advance, the only available time slots for dinner on a Saturday are always 4:45 or 9:45), Peter Luger is worth the drive over to Brooklyn.
Reservations are no guarantee of prompt seating, have a pre-game drink, pop a xanax and you can handle the drama of having a res and getting no love from the hostess.
They were out of cherry, so we got a few slices of apple and one key lime.
I have no complaints about the wait or the service but the pizza was not at all something to write home about.
and you have to order through a pane of bulletproof glass, but the fact of the matter is, after a night of hard drinkin', college style, nothing hits the spot like a big box of inexpensive chicken and fries.
The snooty manager asked us to leave and gave us our check in the middle of our meal.
Its good to go there for drinks if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad.
after such a strong showing, dessert was a letdown per our waiters recommendation, we ordered the raspberry softie the coconut-stuffed apricots the softie tasted like a mixture between cough syrup a starburst, whereas the apricots were extremely sour.
Asked for wine recommendations and the waitress told me her favorites and described them in detail - I don't encounter this much in NYC.
Just expect to wait a good twenty minutes before they take your order (even when the restaurant is half empty), you'll have to ask at least 5 waiters and a manager for coffee before they bring it to you and when they bring your orders out wrong, expect the manager to side with the chef and not you.
Seconds after we permitted our half-eaten fattened goose livers to be whisked away, our waitress materialized, bearing two cold drinks and the chef's profound apologies for the dish - a completely unneccessary but vastly appreciated gesture.
When one of our party brazenly asked to substitue a flavor of gelato for one of the desserts on the menu, the waiter snobbishly told us that, Mario and the chef don't like to do that.
While the place looks rather small and undecorated, I will definitely go back just for the food.
I love the complimentary hot salsa and fresh chips that they put on the table !
After ordering our food was brought to our table very quickly despite the huge crowd.
I guess Mars 2112 keeps the food bland for the family fare, but it only serves to detract from its overall experience.
We had a plate of smoked meats, some stinky cheeses (that's how they were described on the menu), delicious marinated anchovies, and crostini with various vegetable toppings.
A good restaurant would have at least comped desert or sent over a round of drinks for such a long wait -- we didn't even get an apology from a manager.
The staff was knowledgeable about the cuisine and answered my dining questions with professionalism and style.
I like to drink a variety of teas, but I've had some here that are really weird that I would avoid next time.
Sit at the bar, order a glass of wine, and grab an appetizer: they'll also bring you olives, parmesan cheese, a huge loaf of delicious bread and 3 dipping sauces.
We recently went for dinner with two kids and the staff were very accomodating even without reservations.
Service was slow (20 minutes wait time before they came back with our drinks, not including 10 minute wait for them to take our drink order).
sometimes i've just ordered arepas and empanadas for my meal; other times, i've split a dinner entree and an appetizer with a friend and been satisfied, since the portions are so huge.
Go there for dinner this time and find it unusually bad in taste and not pleasent service at all.
The waiter was constantly puching us to have drinks, he told us that we were not ordering properly and insisted on bringing to the table his recommendations.
The journey may be long and the wait may be longer, but there is nothing that could keep me from this pizza.
My friend ordered the scallops which were served in a light red sauce that was complemented very nicely with atichoke palms.
Service is not particularly warm, but I've gone back again and again (for dinner) over the years on an almost monthly basis.
When questioning our server about a certain dish, she kindly brought over the Union Sq.
Instead of going to a fun lounge after dinner, as planned, everyone had paid so much, that we went to a dive bar for the rest of the night for cheap drinks.
The Food The versatile Austrian menu, fused with French and American, rewards both high and low-end appetites: rich, cheese-laden onion soup, grilled Gruyere and country ham sandwiches and big-bunned burgers are as satisfying as velvety liver terrine with kumquat-cranberry compote, speck and sausage charcuterie and inexpensive cheese plates.
Bar has, french fries, bunch of different vegs and fruits, sushi, ribs (not great, wait for the waiters that come around with the meat).
The waiter seemed astounded that I ordered no wine or alcohol -- just water -- with my meal.
The food and drinks held up to eatery's rep and the service was just as good if not better.
Those who choose an omakase (chef's choice) menu will be happily surprised with accents of jalapeno or swaths of homemade sauce cleverly accenting rolls and sushi alike.
As for the food, apart from the Chef's Omakase, the appetizers and rolls are just below mediocre for the price they charged.
I went on a Saturday night on the recommendation of the new General Manager, Mike who also did Cheetah Club and Le Souk.
I definitely liked the vibe in the restaurant - the food is good with enough variety to please everyone - i'd say the portions were quite skimpy where it counts - meat whether fish or steak- and for those prices this is very irksome.
The food had a somewhat elevated price tag but but fair considering the Nobu origin - The cocktails highly recommended including the spide and lobster roll - we were well plated and did not encounter any arragance from the staff - maybe the other student reviewers are used to cafeteria service.
Summary good service, bad food!
We were able to get a table right away on Friday night, but we only saw our server twice and he failed to give us the specials, we overheard him tell the table right next to us after we had ordered and were already into our salads.
People will literally spend their entire lunch break waiting and for what - an average fastfood burger.
The Food Brasserie favorites are prepared by the book: Onion soup gratinee bubbles with a thick layer of Gruyere cheese, and grilled shell steak is served medium-rare, with a side of crisp shoestring potatoes.
Unfortunately, as we were finishing up, the manager hovered around us and asked us to go to the bar to finish our drinks because there were other people waiting.
I adore Zen Palate - and both the formal upstairs dining room and the crowded, counter-style cafe downstair, have their pros and cons.
The last time I went to the restaurant, the waitress made me wait to take my order, then left me without anything to drink throughout the entire meal.
There's very little on their menu if you're trying to avoid cheese and oil - not many grilled entrees at all.
The entree menu is not diverse, but the items on it are all very good.
Our waitress asked us if we wanted anything else, we said only the check - she quickly scooped up our not-yet finished food.
Waiters had to reach over people to deliver food.
The bar bites weren't anything special (we had calamari and wings, very ordinary), but our dinner was phenomonal, as was our service.
It took the waiter over 30 minutes to get our food because the order was misplaced.
One of my favorite places to get a cup of tea or to have a casual brunch with the newspaper.
(The booths remained unoccupied throughout our meal, unless you count the not-very-busy waitstaff.
95 all-you-can-eat lunch is tooted as a good deal but a the ambiance is dreadful and you can get a terrific meal, also kosher vegetarian, in peace with service just around the corner for $2 more.
The place was very crowded usually it is a good indication that the food would be worth the delay.
Low-fat and low-carb options (such as flatbread) lure in health-conscious diners, while everyone else can sink their teeth into warm, crispy baguettes piled with mesquite chicken or smoked turkey, Philly cheese steaks and more.
The menu has many dishes that one can't find anywhere in the city.
Called to complain and the response was well, we didn't charge you for the falafel sandwich we shorted you.
I ordered the strip steak medium - the waiter or the chef reversed our requests.
The tasting menu was delivered at a break-neck pace, leaving no time to enjoy the wine or even digest the food.
The owner himself one time came to our table to clear our dishes when our waiter didn't show (a rare occurance, but it was late at night).
The food is really great but the service is absolutely horrible!
I went back a different night, once again I can't remember which, probably Friday and the place was a ghost town, with a corny DJ and a waitress who couldn't get my friend's drink right after several tries.
My next thought was god i could use a few drinks and a bathroom.
When asked to compare between two dishes, the server said whatever you like.
Apparently the same hostess was also trying to kick out a group of women having drinks at a table and giving them a hard time for holding up a table.
Needing a sugar fix, my husband and I walked in here to find a wall to wall adornment of delightful confections.
One of our diners didn't like her fish and both the waitress and the manager insisted on replacing it.
My friend and I were the ONLY 2 people in the entire place seated for dinner and after sitting there for 15 minutes, I had to walk over to our surly waiter and ask for menus.
The tables weren't bussed and they forgot to make my chai tea, which wasn't all that delicious, not was my friend's coffee.
Don't miss the crema catalana the waiter recommended us for dessert.
The place is a little over-priced for brunch but it is a nice restaurant so that was expected Food (i had the omelette with cheddar, mushrooms and herbs), service, coffee, atmosphere were all fantastic.
I went for an early dinner the other night and encountered the worst service i have experienced in a long time.
Super friendly neighboorhood atmosphere where even a lady can go alone and have a drink and feel comfortable.
If coming to Tea and Anthipathy (yea u heard me) during conventional dining hours, expect a good long wait on the curb till tables open up.
the staff is great, but the food is just ok.
And Mondays fajita are half price all night.
To make matters worse an hour into our dinner we see a waiter take mojitos to another table.
Bringing a large group on a busy Saturday night ,I was afraid quality of food and service might not be up to par, but we were seated promptly and the service by our waitress was fantastic considering how busy it was.
Fifteen minutes later, when we asked about our drinks, another server went to investigate and found that they'd run out of one of the liqueurs they needed and had gone out to get more -- which is fine, but it would've been nice to know.
After 45 mins of waiting in an sans air conditioned bar, we grew tired of paying for over-priced drinks.
PLUS the best wine can be found in the bar but they refused to sell us a bottle!!
I recently attended a celebratory dinner here and I just want to warn everyone that the service is the worst I have ever experienced!
It's very cheap, food is great you can bring your own bottle of wine (saves sooo much money) The waiters will uncork it bring you glasses too !
The Scene Inconspicuous Bottino is an ideal stop for a light lunch or full dinner while gallery-hopping through Chelsea.
Our lovely waiter sent us off with scones for breakfast the following AM!
Our waiter took his sweet time bringing the menus and telling us the specials and it wasn't until almost 10:15 that we put our order in.
On the menu, there are many inexpensive snacks, drinks and meals to choose from.
The presentation was clever, and the food tasty however the service that accompanied it was so slow it made us feel neglected.
I especially love the korean dish's they add into there menu consider its 2 for 1 its hard not to resist with asian cuisine being so expensive in all in New York.
While the people here were nice and the service was very good, the food was not very good - it was extremely greasy, the place did not offer alternatives such as egg whites and PAM spray instead of oil, coffee was average Crystal Rock Office Flavored Coffee - not the good coffee.
SQC is great in the evening, the light is excellent and it's perfect to sit at the bar, eat oysters on the half shell and have a glass of wine.
great trendy spot for a night out but to be honest the food was not worth the cost.
I would have told the wait staff if anyone had asked me if I enjoyed my meal, but no one asked.
Service was a little but flawed, (they brought us beers without the glasses brought the main course out before cleaning off the appetizers) but nothing that would ruin your evening.
As we attempted to digest our meal and browse the dessert menu, the same staff members approached us to move along our order.
I went there for lunch with co-workers and found the service to be prompt and very friendly.
They moved us upstairs to an area where they were setting up for a private party -- we had no server, and had to flag down people setting up for the party to get us drinks, silverware, water, etc.
When we received the bill, we asked the manager to do something about the drinks, considering how poor the service was and her reply was, Well, you got them!
Our apetizers took quite a while to be served, in fact, while all the other tables that sat way after us were being served I asked the waiter what happened to our appetizers, the calamari was tough; The entrees were tasteless and really!, one have to be really bad to mess a simple pasta dish.
I must admit the times my family (6 or more) have had dinner there the service seemed to forget us after serving the main course.
We were seated promptly, and after an inordinate wait, somebody took our drink order and disappeared for half an hour.
Although the atmosphere was lacking, I could definitely recommend a trip to Esca for the fish alone!
Though it might be a wait and the service might leave a little to be desired, anyone that has ever eaten there agrees that the food is worth it.
Best Baked Ziti in the area, great classic NY pizza.
When I asked the waitress she told me it was because I ordered pancakes.
We went out on the town with the idea that we were going to mingle with the in crowd, you know, go to a place where you pay an outrageous cover charge, have to wear all black to fit in, and pay $12 for a watered-down martini, and if you're lucky, have a good time.
Much has been made of Island's lack of french fries--space and cost are cited on the menu--but an order of thick crispy salt and vinegar chips almost satisfies the craving.
Service was atrocious: appetizers came out 3 minutes after we ordered, and 10 minutes before we finally tracked down the bottle of wine we had ordered, the waiter rushed us from start to finish, we had to repeatedly track down someone to pour us more wine since it wasn't at the table, etc, etc.
mapQuest before you go and you'll arrive early enough start off at the bar with a fabulous old school cocktail.
The white tablecloths covering closely-packed, old wood tables; waitresses with accents and up-turned noses; warm firelight ambience; boisterous crowds drinking wine -- it's all here.
My appetizer of endive and bleu cheese salad was a surprisingly large serving which balanced the striped bass entree (served on a bed of vegetables).
When we got there, they refused to seat us because our 4th wasn't there yet-even thought there were only two other people there and we assured them we would order some starters and drinks.
Great roofdeck, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet.
Though the service leaves a lot to be desired, and the waitstaff runs around like chickens without heads, the beer is cold, the sake is hot, and the sushi is out of this world!
People waiting for tables stand at a drink rail next to large windows which open out over a leafy garden in the summertime.
When the group arrived for the Noon lunch the restaurant was only partially set up and the group was forced to eat lunch while the staff noisily set up the restaurant around them.
About 10 of us came here for drinks last friday, the atmosphere was good for chatting and hanging out, but not enough lounge or bar space, they should open up the back area w/ more loungable chairs or booths if they want to catch any after dinner sort of bar crowd.
My friends and I went to dinner last weekend and had a great time.
beside i have to wait long time with my food, waiter service ok but unfriendly.
Our waiter said 3 words to us, wisked away our food as we were finishing, and the maitre'd could not take his eyes off our table waiting for us to leave.
The only downside was our waitress -- she forgot to order one of our side dishes, was not attentive, and then gave us our check before we finished our bottle of wine.
I spent more time looking for a waiter than I did enjoying my meal.
After sitting at the table with empty glasses for a 1/2 hour, we had to ask the busboys to get us drinks as our waiter was nowhere to be found.
The texture of their flat noodles is something that has to be experienced to understand.
The only thing that was a little annoying was that the hostess didnt want to let us finish our first drinks at the bar and kept rushing us to sit down.
You get plenty of food for the price, enough leftovers for lunch and they actually serve garlic chicken with lots of chicken and chinese vegetables.
We heard two different servers telling tables about these specials, and when we asked to hear them, they wouldn't tell us them.
the service was slow took ten mins to get me a glass of water.
The freshness of the ingredients down to the perfection of the crust, it is truly the best.
The menu looked good, except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside.
The waiter, and someone at the next table, were both correct when they said that the lobster was delicious, but I though the price was a little steep.
They were rude, didn't know their drinks and were unable to demonstrate any professionalism in their service mentality.
But the service was absolutely terrible, and we watied 45 minutes for food.
Yes, the prices SEEM afordable, but the portions are so small that you end up spending $100+ just to fill 2 people and get a couple drinks.
The food was good but we were dissatisfied with waiting too long for a uncomfortable table.
I asked the waiter to move us to another table because we didn't want to rush our meal.
Like the other Bromberg Brothers establishments, expect the customer is always wrong attitude from the staff along with overpriced wines you never heard of, no bar, tiny waiting area and lousy desserts.
Service was horrendous the night we went for dinner.
The sangria was served quickly and often.
We ordered coffee, and then he ordered a bacon cheeseburger (for $12, ridiculous even for New York) The waiter then announced he was going to charge us a $4 sharing charge.
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says I love you.
We were seated promptly for a Saturday lunch, but service was incredibly slow.
The menu offers favorites from all over China: mellow Lake Tung-Ting shrimp from Hunan; peppery Sichuan tofu with minced pork; and Shanghainese soups with pickled mustard greens.
My only complaint is waiting a bit between the appetizer and the main course but it was well worth it.
The service could be better but the management (Mariano) is quite helpful if there are any problems.
As we were finishing our dessert, a nearby waitress dropped a tray and HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE splattered all over my neck, hair and sweater and my boyfriend's clothes.
And forget about having a drink at the bar to take the edge off because the space between tables is so narrow that you'll be shoved by the wait staff who are desparate to get their job done.
Also, try to get a seat at the main bar, because I sat at the smaller bar by the entrance and it was getting so crowded with people waiting that it became a bit unpleasant towards to end of the meal.
The sandwiches, platters, and pitzas are top notch too, but I could make a meal just out of their pita bread and babaganoush.
At dinner on a Saturday night, I was enthused by the bustling, unpretentious crowd and the lusciously warm lighting.
It's the New York you thought was long gone; orders are spoken, not yelled, and the staff knows the names of patrons' dogs.
Their service can use a little assistance, but their food is great.
I told the waiter that my drink tasted very bad and asked if he could swap it out for a Petron Margarita.
The overpriced ice cream is delicious but the service is atrocious - not only do I have to wait to be admitted into this ice cream joint, but the waiter is a snide, gruff man more suited to be a trucker than an ice cream shop server.
We didn't see him the rest of the night, the other courses come out sporadically, and no one ever asked if we wanted more wine (which we did) or refilled our water -- even after we flagged down another waiter, nothing happened.
After demanding a free round of drinks from a third manager, our party decided to bail on this horrific french import.
You have to wait in line most of the time, but the burgers are worth it and the beer is cheap.
We had a reservation for Monday lunch and were seated promptly, which was a pleasant surprise.
Maybe it was the choices the chefs had put on the Restaurant Week Menu, but much of our food was just so-so.
Our dinner was enhanced by a 1999 Pinot Grigio, recmmended by the waitress.
And the ambience is very cool, stop by on a Saturday afternoon and you can play some old school games while having a beer.
The waitress even gave us a complimentary dessert- warm chocolate lava cake with a scoop of cinnamon ice cream, what a perfect end to a perfect dinner!
The menu can give you price shock but the food, service and drinks are worth every stinking penny.
After the rude waitress took our order we were sipping our drinks when the manager comes over and says we have to leave as the tables are reserved for dinner patrons.
Don't know if the bar is really that bad, BUT the food would more than compensate!
We were promptly seated - the waitress was very attentive, got us drinks and menus.
I think I'm going to start taking the food and coffee to go b/c everytime I go there (which is quite often) I get more frustrated with the service.
The best aspect of Dylan Prime is that it's a perfect spot for a first date, a business dinner, a casual night-on-the-town or even just a quite bite at lunch.
The host was aloof; my waitress, though sweet, didn't seem to know the food or the menu very well; and the waiter we flagged over to order our wine seemed as if he had never looked at the wine list before.
Our food was delivered in a timely fashion but if you wanted another drink or your check you had to hunt down your server.
I liked the beer selection!
The manager never came to our table and the restaurant didn't offer anything to compensate for the error (they could have taken the two cocktails off the check ).
I don't expect an enormous, heaping plate of food, but c'mon.
Generous portions of rice porridge and noodles really hit the spot after fighting the crowds on a busy weekend in Chinatown.
With so many $20 bottles of wines from which to choose, our waiter helped pick a good one.
It's a small and quaint place so have your expectations in check, but that doesn't mean anything bad - know going in that you are gonna eat some serious food!
The party space worked out well for our rehearsal dinner.
The Wasa Waffle was different but when we spoke to the manager he inmediatly changed if for another dish (He suggested the Chocolate decadence French Toast.
We waited 30 minutes to be seated, 40 minutes for water, bread, menus, 30 more for wine and soft drinks and when the food finally arrived an hour later, it was inedible, burned on top from sitting under a heat lamp.
Meals not served at once and service was inattentive and forgetful.
Seated in the upstairs part of the restaurant my party and I were subjected to rude, abrupt service and unmercifully long waits for our food.
The food is very good for the price.
The owner lied to me when i asked where our food was 1 hour after we placed the order - he said oh your friend said you were not ready for it.
Never heard anything about a minimum required food order of $30 or had any bad experiences with the staff.
we saw another waitress spill hot coffee on another diner's foot.
Our waiter took his time taking our drink orders ('97 Italian red was good).
I've heard all the complaints about food and staff at this place, and perhaps some people have had an unfortunate encounter with the host or a cranky waiter.
I waited for 45 minutes for my entree to realize that the waiter never put the order in.
We waited in standing at the entrance for 5 mins to get seats due to just slow service, another 10mins to get menu, and then another 10mins to get water bread.
The guacamole at $7 is a small portion served with a stack of Si!Ortega flat taco shells.
The sign outside said, 26 beers on tap, however the bartender was unable to pull a pint from any of them.
Superfine is my preferred destination in the city when I'm looking for a casual, hip atmosphere, extraordinary food at decent prices and/or just a place to get a good drink, chat with the bartender and shoot some (free) pool.
They have a lot of beautiful clientele, gay and straight, plus you#146;ll spot random famous actors on occasion.
When spending upwards of $200 for dinner for two, I expect better service.
I left feeling unsatisfied, except for having a nice chance to people watch in the cozy atmosphere with my over-priced pasta bolognese.
I had dinner with a few of my friends, and it was the best we've had in a long time.
Their bagels have the perfect softness to them, but on the outside there's a bit of crispiness to give it a bit of texture.
our appetizers came out relatively quickly, but it was near impossible to get a hold of a waiter to order and get our drinks.
The food is average, however the service is way below average (our waiter was a stuttering fool when it came to the specials and left our drinks empty for the majority of the night) The atmostphere is cheesy as well as the crowd.
$25 prix fixe sounds like a good deal, but dinner was still $100 for two, the portions were small, and the ($35) wine, clearly where the money is made, mediocre.
The manager came out very defensively and insisted that it was a 2 lb lobster.
Nice family place, nice atmosphere, but don't go there for pizza.
The host's explanation was they could not control when people finish dinner.
If you're going to label spicy items on your menu as spicy (like the Buffalo and Cajun wraps), I think you should go ahead and label all the spicy items as spicy.
Our salads and appetizers were brought at the same time and we barely had time to enjoy them before a team of waiters whisked them (and our bread!)
Mysteriously, the reserved tables all stayed empty throughout our meal and were still empty when we left an hour later.
Our booth style seats would've been more romantic if our waitress, though nice, was less intrusive, and the loud music from its bar didn't filter thru so much.
My grandmother-in-law had a problem with her meal, and the manager AND chef came over and offered to replace it and/or take it off the check.
Large portions of food to share.
During the summer the outdoor area is a great place to sit and eat you pizza.
From making the reservation (not required) to the before dinner drink (cava), to the table (romantic), to the the ambiance (candles, spanish antiques, etc) to the food of course (original, incredibly deep and rich in flavor) to our departure and saying goodnight to the waiter.
Staples are available every which way--tacos hard and soft, wrapped in tortillas stuffed with guacamole, cheese or black beans; burritos of beef, breaded catfish, pork pipian and chipotle chicken; plus a choice of four sauces from mild to just plain stupid.
After our waitress brought us menus took our drink orders, a diff hostess came over asked us to give up our table.
The waitstaff told us that they had already run out of one of the entrees (before 8 p.
(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.
I am hoping the stale service was a one shot deal because it was deplorable for what we paid for dinner!
There are a few chefs who aren't very enthusiastic and not very theatrical, but the end product is always great food.
The crust was a crispy tan dream come true with those little blackened air bubbles and chewy center.
The waitress, host, and bus staff were sitting around at the bar while the patrons were all complaining about the service.
The menu options were not appealing, we had to beg the waiter to ask the chef if we could have just a plain dinner salad to start as their salad choices were not appetizing.
My only complaint is that the place is over crowded on weekends, but that's the price you pay for having such great food.
The Food In a health-conscious century, it's as likely to be the pub grub as it is the booze that does you in.
But the food here is excellant and there are just too many appetizers (in the traditional custom of Korean restaurants) to sample.
The smell near the bar is unbearable, the food is so so, nothing out of the norm, just very plan.
This happened while many diners were enjoying their meal and it was rudes.
The food and wine selection is superb and the chef brings it all together each and every time.
But even on New Years, when they were busy, the owners took the time out to visit our table frequently, even pouring us drinks herself from her own creations.
However the manager came over and aplogized and all drinks were on him.
The service was horrendous, not only did the waiter take an hour to remember we ordered drinks, we were rushed to eat and get out so they could seat the next party.
A friendly staff works the room, delivering favorites like crisp, crackling spring rolls and shredded pork rolls wrapped in rice paper.
They gave us desert menus but never came back for a desert order, instead we had to ask for the check and a bus boy retreived it for us.
The hostess did offer free drinks to my party due to the wait, but we were more interested in eating after said long wait.
The french fries are soggy, the service is so/so and while it looks like a cute little homestyle cafe you'd find in SF, the food is below average.
I had to wait 1hr since I got there around 8pm but you could have a few drinks by the bar since the ambiance is very loungy/ club like.
The portions were so big that after a cocktail drink we had no room left for desert.
We sat way before 2 other tables ahead of us that rec'd their appetizers before us; the waiter neglected to apologize.
I also watched several other frustrated customers getting the wrong orders or trying to catch the waiter's attention (he was posing at the soda fountain).
Our waiter ask us what kind of soufle we wanted and told us to get 2, making us believe that it was part of the pre-fixe, nope soufles are seperate and we were so full from dinner we could barely finish one.
After our initial order, the waitress wasn't very attentive (we had to wait 15 minutes at a time to get her attention to refill drinks, order desert, etc).
The first time my husband and I went there, both the appetizer and entreee I ordered were not available, but we had a waitress who was really on top of things.
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.
The hamburger showed up long before the mussels, and the waiter suggested I start eating because he didnt want my food to get cold.
B/c the dinner focused on good friends and good food, not waiting around for service or being bothered by rude staff to leave.
(Though the filet won't be enough if both have hearty apitites.
The prices were moderate for fine dining, and although the restaurant is relatively small, it was easy to have a quiet conversation even though the tables are fairly close together.
Our waiter was not attentive, we waited about 20 mins just to order drinks.
i ate here with a friend by default-- we were in the meatpacking district on a saturday night, every place in the area was pretty much booked, we were hungry, i only drink sake, and he was treating :).
I planned a holiday dinner at Kurio and we ended up waiting two hours for the appetizers.
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles.
Serving things like Chicken Kiev with a garlic mashed potato egg roll for $$ with the snooty attitude to match!
Blue Ribbon Sushi has far more than a cult following, packed daily from Noon till 3 AM, with hipsters, celebrities, Sashimi Lovers, and of course SOHO locals, it's breath taking menu, Superb Fare, Lengthy Sake List, and pro seating system have earned it a 5 STAR rating with The Sushi Times: 6 years running.
Park your trench coat at the coat check and be prepared for fine dining, expert / attentive table service and a delectable cuisine.
Especially the manager or host who kept walking by and giving us the evil eye to see the progress of our dinner so they could turn the table over to other customers.
Again, since I go out to dinner several times a week in NY, I am used to paying high prices and do not mind at all.
Generally, the food was fine, but the table is too small to eat comfortably.
Food presented well and the service once we were seated was great but we had a long wait for our table (about half an hour) even though I had pre-booked.
OUr waiter was a little confused about how to serve champagne.
Food is decent but portions so small that after 5 appetizers, 2 sides and three entrees, the three of us left still hungry!
Once dinner ended the party really started going inside they were playing great music.
Their delivery of fresh hot pizza.
i went on a thursday evening and the restaurant was pretty empty the server got our drinks wrong 3 times!
Sushi pieces are smaller if u r a 'buffet' customer and choices are rather limited and there's really nothing special on the menu.
The bigger sin is the service --our waiter was late with our main dishes, late with the bill, which was totaled incorrectly (twice).
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.
Went to Brasserie for restaurant week dinner and maybe it was the menu but the food was very bland and it was something that I could have eatten at home.
I have never been treated more rudely than I was by the hostess and the manager of Public for brunch last Sunday; the hostess was arrogant, despicable, and mean to our party (reminder: she is a hostess in the service industry).
Zero decor, this is not a date place--just a great place to get a quick, tasty and cheap meal.
Besides the price, here are some other annoyances: bleaching the floors during the dinner and automatically charging you 20% gratuity on your credit card without your knowledge.
The Food Chef-owner Tom Valenti's food makes just as much noise; he cooks in a masculine, big-flavored, meat-and-potatoes style, rich with terrines, mustards, eggs and bitter greens.
The service always ruins your food if it's poor.
The staff didn't even tell us (college kids) about the prix-fixe special, but the pair of older adults sitting next to us took advantage.
Place was empty, waitress was rude, told us that even though there were drink specials at the bar (2 for 1 margaritas), we couldn't have them at our table and we couldn't go up to the bar to get drinks.
After being treated like we were at Nobu by the hostess, our waitress brought us our check before we even asked for it and denied us a 2nd round of drinks because.
Don't let the ambiance of this place fool you, the food is far better than many pricey establishments.
However, our one and only complaint was when I received my drink I gave my coupon to our waiter, he returned minutes later to tell me that it could not be used in the dining room, only at the lounge or at the bar.
For lunch, walk in slightly after 1pm to avoid long lines.
Long wait for our meal (approx 30 minutes), unusual slow service, waitresses (especially the preety one with black hair) louder thn clients, do not care much for customers.
We happen to walk by, read the menu posted outside they offered a nice selection ranging from citrus salmon, pan seared trout, chicken pot pie, sirlion steak, the fried calamari is out of this world they use a secret ingredient to their dipping sauce.
Additionally, one of the waiters found it necessary to walk around the restaurant, telling people how to eat their food.
The food is not five star but the prices reflect that.
The price was right too--I spent under $30 for my entree and two drinks.
Obviously we did not get right service and nobody said soory for that and other restaurant guests who came after us got quicker dish than us.
I won't even wait for an hour and a half when I don't have reservations, but the hostess and the pompous maitre d' just jerked me around and kept on promising me that I'd be the next to be seated.
Went to Chow Bar for dinner, I thought it was kind of pricey, but the food and the service was good - but it wasn't incredibly busy, so maybe they just had more free time to devote to us.
What I don't get is asking a high rolling, forgiving of bad service, drink guzzling table like mine to leave as soon as we finished out last sip of $12 martinis and left a 25% tip.
I love the food here, and although it is pricey, the entree comes with rice, naan, dal, and salad, which makes it worthwhile.
our waiter spilled an entire glass of water on my brother and didn't so much as acknowledge it, let alone apologize.
The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.
My friends and I had a great time - the atmosphere was exciting but didn't encroach on us while we had our meal and drinks (which is better, the kiwitini or the watermelon martini?)
If you like an ecclectic crowd and an overall good time where you and your friends can get together whether it be to eat, drink or just play some good old pictionary (they provide crayons and a blank white sheet at every table), go to the Cargo!
the food at pongal is average, the rava masala dosa is much better at madras mahal (a few doors down) and certainly the service at pongal is the worst among the indian restaurants along that block.
I followed my handsome waiter's suggestions for everything from my cranapple martini, BBQ duck tostada appetizer and rum-glazed pork tenerloin entree to the scandalously good brownie sundae.
As expected, the wine list is as thoughtful as the menu the staff has earned my trust with their bullet-proof recommendations I have yet to be disappointed from their exhaustive list.
The ambiance and service is great but I wish I could say the same about the food.
The food is just ok, not at all worth having to put up with the disgusting staff, the manager/owner in particular.
Our waiter never once asked how everything was, as I suspect he knew the kitchen was producing seriously average food.
The prices did not reflect the quality of the meal.
We were crammed next to the people who were seated to the right of us, who repeatedly took phone calls during dinner, while the rude wait staff did nothing despite the warning on the menu that cell phones were not to be used in the dining room.
The Food The daily-changing menu, scrawled on large dry-erase boards, offers a blend of haute cuisine and Texas roadhouse fare.
Although we had to wait a few minutes for our table, the manager bought us a round of drinks and proceeded to take care of throughout the entire meal.
The Food When the counter guy asks, Would you like better fries with that?
My wife and I invited our friends to a late dinner and were having drinks afterwards when the manager instructed the waitress not to serve us any more drinks as it was bottle service.
I am not sure if this was just an off night or what, our waiter forgot wine, brought us desert menus before dinner came, then brought us the wrong dinner.
Generous portions on the entrees.
We asked for the manager who told us that it was their first time serving brunch, to be patient and that our bill would be discounted.
The rude and unaccomodating hostess (who we later learned was the manager) repeatedly promised us the next table but never offered to buy us a drink while we waited.
The waiter asked us several times after dinner whether we had paid our bill yet, and after we had, he came over to make sure that we hadn't just hidden it from him or something.
Not a destination restaurant, but if you're hungry for breakfast or lunch, big portions and good quality for the money.
Good wines under $100 are included in the predominantly French list, but take some ferreting out to find.
anyway, nice place for brunch for selection under $20 meals desserts were great (3 flavors for creme brulee!!
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix: Appetizers were ok, waiter gave me poor suggestion.
The Food Nothing makes for better bar snacks than this down-home Southern menu.
After spending about 2 hours in the restaurant our waiter decided to call it a night without even asking if we wanted dessert.
Half the menu is comprised of original creations while the other half consists of unique slants on orthodox cuisine such as the single super-sized gnocchi with cinammon.
Not only did we have to flag the waiter down every time for every course or request, but they spilled our drinks twice all over the table - and once was hot tea.
Second, the value was great; after ordering a ton of food and several drinks, the bill still came to less than $40 a person (though I suspect that the nice manager might have given us a few freebees!
After reading the negative sushi reviews, my boyfriend and I opted for their Korean fare.
After dinner I walked over to the cheese counter -after having been greeted by a rude server, I was shocked to see how dissapointing their cheese selection was: it is miniscule, many of the fresh chevre cheese were more than ready to be tossed, etc.
The waitresses are at your table filling your water or oil before your last sip or dip.
The first time, the food was decent for lunch, but remember mediocre service.
We walked out the door with only a drink in each of us and the bill was still over $100.
The pancakes were good, but don't have blueberry pancakes on the menu of you are not able to produce more than three tiny blueberries in each pancake.
Our waiter disappeared entirely, our food, when we were finally able to order it, arrived without plates (we had to go and track down a busboy to get them), and when we were finished, we couldn't get the check, even after walking across the restaurant to request it.
90 for a porterhouse steak for 2 (ordered medium-rare, delivered well-done, dry and tasteless) and I'm not even full.
The food was good but our waiters were pushy,rude and dumb.
I would wait for a table next time, the food was that good.
We did complain to the manager, but she just said there are problems in the kitchen and took the drinks off bill.
the service was inattentive (didn't bring us wine til our main course was already served and didn't open the bottle in front of us!!!
decent, if greasy, fishsticks, but served on a mound of soggy fries that could feed about 5-6 people!
The Filet Mignon is awesome, along with everything else on the menu.
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
Pork chops is probably the best choice on the menu.
Ofcourse the restaurant is new and perhaps they have some kinks to work out, but it for the same price you can get a higher caliber brunch at Banania or Cafe Luluc on Smith St.
Having heard that the steakhouse had a tendency to overcook the steaks, I asked the waitress that she ask the chef to prepare it closer to rare than medium.
After waiting more than 15 minutes for our order to be taken and then having the waitress not know how to make certain drinks, our party of 7 was obviously dissatisified.
The service is great - they are very attentive and fast, however, they do make faces and comments when you order alot of the ALL YOU CAN EAT food.
Catch a Yankee, Mets game, have a burger and great conversation with the bar keep.
the manager was nice profecional and service was average but the food was not italian, a diner is better, try po'
Bill for three with 7 plates, glass of sangria each and coffee and one dessert was 45 each with tip - not too bad but a tad overpriced for the serving size of the dishes.
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.
The food is above average, though the portions a tad small, even for tapas; but they more than make up for it with their wonderfull mojitos.
Our waiter was inattentive throughout the meal, took nearly 3 hours for dinner.
The service was attentive but overdone for the tiny and very ordinary setting and poor food.
We waited in the bar area and had an excellent time waiting for dinner with the bartender and staff.
Had the calves liver alla veneziana in a fine rich and complex sauce with perfectly fried onions.
Sure the service isn't the best but the food is tasty and the prices are great.
I ordered the flounder special - the fish was fresh but the dish lacked flavor.
The waitress never came back to get drink refills and we didn't get water until we were halfway through our dinner.
Great place for a first date or dinner with a picky group.
I'd recommend getting an appetizer b/c the dinner takes a bit to be cooked, but it was definitely worth the wait.
After ordering a good amount of sushi the waiter asked me if that was all I wanted.
The guy was pleasant and friendly but that only goes so far when you are hungry and have to wait 2 hours for a pizza.
For 2 patrons paying over $100 for dinner, you'd think that the waiter would check to see if everything was okay with the dining experience, and he certainly did not.
Even a modest bottle of wine was accurately described by the wait staff and pleasing.
He met me for wine tasting/sampling of food the week before and made sure that the service was on their toes.
Our spastic waiter was running around like a chicken with his head cut off, and, thus, slow to take our order, slow to bring us our drinks (they sat on the bar for 5-10 minutes) and slow to get us the water we had to ask for repeatedly.
We had an hour for lunch, and service was impeccable each time.
The menu is an exact replica of its sister location in New Mexico - right down to the Frito Pie (don't knock it till you've tried) and a killer array of margaritas.
Also, neither our waiter or busboy ever came back to ask if we wanted more to drink or even refill our WATER glasses.
I just think the prices are high for the type of food the kitchen turns out as well as the portion sizes.
Sit at the bar and eat here regularly and the sushi chef who is also the owner will hook you up the best cuts of fish.
I used to love the Dog but now its become a metling pot of really undesirable people.
ambience and decoration was nice but for a check of $330 for 5 for brunch and with just average food.
We placed a delivery order - 2 pastas and a caprese and they took and 1 1/2 to get here and the food was inedible when we received it.
The appetizers are really pricey particularly once you see the size (or lack thereof).
It is never a ridiculous wait no more than 30 minutes, in the meantime you can chat with your friends and start the week-end off right with a signature drink from the bar!
PS : to the waitresses and waiters at Shanghai Cafe(new name of Shanghai Gourmet) if you don't like your job, don't work there.
Deborah, the chef and co-owner, is an extraordinary talent - she has not received the notoriety she deserves - and her food, while not expensive, really merits a two or three star rating.
Sometimes I wish there were a bar to sit at and have a glass of wine, but on the other hand the lack of one allows the place a pleasant sit down sort of feel.
* Rude waiter - he kept pushing us to get appetizer (after been told twice that we would like to start ordering entree) and after dinner, told us to check out the shelf ourselves on our way to the restroom for dessert menu.
Service was a treat from my French (Canandian)waiter who knows more about wine than anyone waiting on me in NYC in a long time.
But overall loved the place, outside of our waiter who literally tried to force us into ordering drinks.
I had a nice time, place was crowded but the food was very good.
The small wooden bar and counter up front incorporate a wine rack and dessert display.
But a server coming up to the table chewing gum while she went through the specials is not my idea of professional.
The menu of Afghani favorites includes mantoo, the spicy beef dumplings in yogurt sauce; chicken with walnuts and pomegranate juice; saffron-marinated filet mignon; grilled Cornish game hen; meat and fish kebabs in various combinations; and a number of vegetarian rice- and bean-based dishes.
Affordable starters comprise most of the menu: Cheese plates with sweet-sour chutneys, spicy lamb-stuffed fried olives and plump mussels baked under saffron-herb breadcrumbs are addictive, but signature tigelle panini fixings shouldn't be missed.
Knew we were in trouble when the waiter spilled our cocktails on the table and couldn't be bothered to bring new silverware.
Went for dinner last Friday night with 2 friends, and the staff was incredibly nice.
Nothing too special about the location or the atmosphere, but DAMN, the pizza is good.
Overall, cute place with poor service, and even worse food.
As for price, there are plenty of Shanghai restaurants in Chinatown that are just as inexpensive with better food and without a doubt much better customer service.
Although it was quite good, the small portions at this table of 4, including appetizers, did not constitute adequate sustenance.
When I pointed this out to the waiter he told me that all of the lox is like that.
We had to wait 30 minutes before the waiter even came to our table and had to ask 4 times just to get a glass of water.
The place was packed but we were able to get drinks at the bar w/out a problem despite the crowd.
Although, a limited menu, we had no trouble picking out our delicious meal.
It's got funky, fun furniture and a round bar at the front, which is convenient for those waiting to be seated and be prepared to wait for a while, if you don't have reservations.
The waiters are sometimes grouchy and the decor doesn't change, but the food is always delicious and satisfying.
The lunch got a little bizarre when we asked the waiter how the joint got it's name, and he made his hands into cups in reference to placing them on a woman's breasts and said, No, not this.
The Food Despite the restaurant's name, the menu is remarkably Atkins-friendly, from the nibble bowls of spicy fried chickpeas to the grilled slabs of salt-flecked, smoky rib-eye, succulent chunks of rosemary roast chicken and fat tubes of springy grilled squid.
The owner roasts his own meats and makes fabulous and interesting sandwiches--the house-roasted ham with celery-root salad and tomatoes on a baguette deserves a prize.
The kitchen also offers just a few sushi-free entree options, such as a masterful tempura dinner and chicken or salmon teriyaki.
After fifteen minutes, when nobody even took our drink order, I looked around to try to get our waitresses attention only to see she and about five others of the waitstaff were having an endless gabfest by the register.
By this I mean that the guy selling hotdogs outside of Grand Central has given me better service.
I went to Mocca with my boyfriend for a few drinks and food, and I was really impressed by the service.
First had a cheese platter at the bar and then enjoyed a nice dinner with friends.
The food is so good that there tends to be a little bit of a wait.
I've had the same steak at Peter Lugers for double the price.
When we finally got our waiters attention - and explained to him we were unhappy with our entrees, his demeanor changed completely, he took our dishes and walked away without taking another order for us or asking if he could get us anything else.
Our waitress was so fun- I wanted her to join us for dinner.
No condiments on table or offered, service average, smokey upon arrival as the kitchen is fully exposed and the space very tight.
Here's how it works: you walk in, sit down, and have a vegetarian thali (group of little portions of curries) that invariably includes lentiles, a small salad, some rice, some kind of samosa-like pastry, yogurt, rice, and a couple of sauces.
They have a great selection of wines, and have recently expanded with a Wine Bar around the corner that's accessible through the main dining room.
For the price ($8), the quality of the buffet is great!
Though if the restaurant got bigger, the service and quality of the food would probably suffer.
from the white sheets that hang when you come into the restaurant, to the gorgeous marble communal table in the center of the bottom floor, to the great atmosphere upstairs at the bar.
On our second trip, our waiter had an attitude, was slow to bring/refill drinks, and we had to flag him down for EVERYTHING.
Although we didn't have a reservation, my husband and I enjoyed the food and drinks at the kitchen side seating.
servers never ONCE asked how we were doing - they brought out food late and if extra additions were requested, they came out 20 min after.
As we were wrapping up a very rushed meal--appetizers were barely started when the entrees arrived crowding a table for two at which three were crammed--the hostess charged over and grabbed a half-full wine glass declaring thanks ladies, I'll get your check.
Our waitress (and the chef himself) helped us a bit with the Austrian cuisine where we had questions, and every recommendation was right on.
My party got the dessert sampler which included 6 highlights from the dessert menu--each of which were worth the price of the three course meal ($90 per person with margaritas, tax, and tip).
The waiter never once came back to our table to ask how our meal was OR if we needed another drink.
The ambience is simple, yet elegant and be sure to finish your meal with their famous shlog.
The decor is a little plain and the seating is a touch too close but its worth it for the food.
The food is average and the service is insulting.
And after we ordered our food, their wine guy suggested the wine that he thought would go best with our selections, and it was surprisingly not a high-priced bottle.
Snack on a bowl of fried chickpeas while you browse the menu, then move onto the tender lamb skewers, which arrive atop a slab of French bread, perfectly poised to catch the meat's sweet drippings.
The place is hip and the decorations funky, but the food is lacking.
i would not go after the early bird b/c its not worth it, find better food for full prices.
I would not return for a $30 entree of inadequate portions.
Waiter ignored us, never asked if we needed anything, never received a dessert menu or asked if we wanted coffee, or even the check.
The food at Forest Hills was great, the service more than perfect, but but the ambience was too hot they do not have AC and the employes was sweating a lot , it was a nasty esxperience because I eat in front of the service that was sweating like animals.
The menu goes on to include some of traditional greek favorites but each has a twist that will suprise and delight you.
be prepared for a long wait at dinner.
We ordered the recommended dessert ahead of time as they suggested but when it came time for it, the waiter had forgotten it.
if you do though just wait at the bar (yummy drinks!
IT'S GREAT COFFEE BUT THE SERVICE IS SERVED WITH BIG TIME ATTITUDE.
There was a nice atmosphere except for the few pompous patrons who looked way too gaudy or a lunch time meal, but overall its a great place to eat.
The waiter knows us now, and the owner bought us a round of drinks once because the dessert took too long (in his opinion, we didn't even complain).
After each of them had had one drink, one of the managers came up to our table and told us that he no longer felt comfortable serving us any more margaritas.
The staff even went out of their way to print up menus without prices at my request, since the dinner party was my treat.
Great place to go for a lunch date or for coffee after a date.
However, you're bothered by things like sub-par food (don't get the cajun fries), waiters who hate you and anything that looks like you, close proxmitity with strangers, and cheap talking and singing skelletons, do NOT go.
At the end of the meal, I politely asked the waitress whether she would comp something, and she said yes.
The service is more than attentive, and they also have a $10 corking fee so you can bring your own wine.
When I tried getting a lunch order delivered, I was told I was out of the delivery range (strange since I am also located in the East Village).
The tables are a little too close together, but when the food is this good it's difficult to be distracted.
WHen I politely asked for a water he pointed to the waiter and looked the other way!
The presentation of some of the dishes and desserts were great but taste and quality of the food was sub-par especially for the prices that we were paying.
The margaritas took me on an instant vacation, and although there was a bit of a wait for a table, the food was well worth it.
The food did come out quickly and was good, but not worth the prices or the wait.
A terrific place to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner.
Our waiter didn't even bothered to ask for dessert.
The main floor space is lovely, but cavernous (which means *VERY* noisy), so our server was especially patient with us since we couldn't hear each other or her half the time.
The daily fresh fish can be remarkably good, served in a variety of combinations, ranging up to the omakase chef's choice dinner.
Since we already have our drinks there is no choice, so we are forced to pay full price.
They charge $24 for entrees and ask additional price of $3 for rice or $6 for vegetables as side dish!
I love the creative rolls that they have on their menus, and none of them were a disappointment.
When I went in for dinner this Sunday, after a 2 month absence, I noticed their addition of table cloths, which really add to the ambiance and I noticed that their wine list has been expanded.
The only problem we had was with an incompetent waitress and floor manager which slowed down our food and seating.
If you want great Italian food, fairly price, good service, in Brooklyn, a couple of subway stops from Union Square,(where you should complain about the prices) go to Al Di La.
The centerpiece of the menu is a range of sushi and sashimi sets: standard pieces and rolls that are adequately fresh and reliable.
None of us were able to get drinks in a timely fashion, and the bartender was EXTREMELY rude to us.
A few of us went the other night for cocktails (half price!)
The waitress had the gall to ask us to close out our check when she brought our food so she could go home rather than wait for us to finish (hey babe we waited for YOU, you can wait for US).
Portions enough for 2 meals.
There is no way the food and service here are worth the prices they charge.
the 3rd however, the waiter forgot to put in our order for food and we ended up waiting an hour for them (b/c they were really busy).
i've ordered a cheese plate there, too- the kitchen makes it for you even though it's not on the menu!
not large portions - my boyfriend's entree looked more like an appetizer, and all we got out of the dinner was a $100 tab and hunger for more food.
While the bar is expansive, the ceilings are high, the tables are spacious and the plates are oversized, where is the food?
When the bill finally arrived, the head waiter sternly told us that this time is okay, but next time you have to order more than 2 appitizers and a main course!
Try a traditional latin favorite like Arroz con pollo (yellow rice w/ chicken red bell pepper) but meat lovers should definitely not miss out on the churrasco!
The waiters knocked over my purse 3 times and spilled water on the table 3 times as well.
The point of dining here is to get several Tasting plates (two of us shared 5 @ $12/each and were quite full), and try as many of the dishes on the menu as possible.
ASK for spice adjustments or for special orders, if you think you'll need them, BUT most dishes are GREAT as the staff prepares them.
Waiters poured wine like water, my guests were wondering out loud if they would get straws for the wine next.
Even though the food was prepared nicely, it was definitely lacking flavor.
The waiters were rude, and the appetizer dip had bits of bread in it from someone else's dinner.
Could have gone to Pastis for a salad three times the size for the same price.
When they brought out the food the waiter dropped one of the plates right in front of us and didn't appologize or bring us out a complimentry plate.
Where else can you go to get freshly made Italian food at ridiculously low prices?
Caffeine addicts will have to find their fix elsewhere as coffee is curiously not on the menu, but the Singha beer and decent wine list more than compensates.
If you've got the money and don't mind being packed in like sardines - then cozy on up to the Sushi Bar (much better than a table) and let Gari work his Omikase magic.
So we said we would have a drink at the bar (the only redeaming quality or value in the whole place was the bartender and the big vodka sour she made me).
The drinks are just as expensive as the chain coffee houses.
I had to chase down our waitress for the food and the bill.
They draw you in with a fancy looking decore which obviously cost a mint, ply you with overpriced wines (one bottle I knew was a 6$and they had the nerve to charge 40) This place sufferes from the same problem Areos does, it rests on its reputation.
the setup is cool with pool table and chill area in front and dining on side and back.
The Scene An outing to this ski lodge-sized hot spot, with one of the city's most expansive and popular outdoor patios, feels more like a night spent at a fashion show than dinner at a restaurant--and not just because of the celebrity sightings.
Went with three people last saturday night - half way through our entrees we tried to order a second bottle of wine - both the hostess and waitress told us no, cause, ehh, the place is very crowded this night guys.
Few styles of cooking place such an importance on texture--baby eels in a sizzling slick of oil, for example, is nudged just a shade away from pasta by the crackle of tiny bones under your teeth.
This place is so unexpected, just a tiny little bar, but it serves dinner and even a really good weekend brunch.
Also the waiter anever asked if the steaks were cooked to out liking or if we wanted anything else.
after dinner we went downstairs atmosphere was completely different , nice crowd , we stayed there more time than expected.
The Scene Shun Lee Palace is popular with midtown locals, possibly because the upscale room means you can impress a client and have Chinese for lunch at the same time.
Food was ok, but not worth the 1 hour wait (we sat down an hour after our reservation time) If you are going to make people wait a LONG time, then at least build a bigger bar.
Food is average, service is awful, and the attitude isn't New York - it's just plain rude - and most of NYC is caring and courteous.
We went there just for dinner, and the place was so good we didn't leave.
Sadly, many people feel the need to berate their server for a stronger drink.
Flavors range from standards to hard-to-find Italian options, like tiramisu, hazelnut and zuppa inglese.
The dinner menu promises creative-yet-comforting fare, such as beef brisket in a red wine and fig sauce, panko-crusted tofu over hijiki salad, and a six-spice beef burger.
I read about this place in the Post, but never stepped foot in it I ordered a red velvet cake to be delivered to lOwer Manhattan; It got there, and the broads at the office raved about it!
it's a joy to watch the chef work, who refused to take my order but seeing him open my live scallop made me understand why.
The mussles had be be a portion of maybe 8-9 mussles only and the gnocci were basically all garlic- garlic is just meant to be a condiment- way tooo much garlic.
Do not go to this restaurant unless you like paying high prices for small protions, ordering a drink that arrives 20 minutes later, or ordering a meal only to get the side dish 5 minutes after you're done.
2 weeks ago, I decided to set up a birthday dinner in this establishment and was wary with the reviews I've read in City Search but it seems to be a perfect scene.
When he mentioned that a pinot noir would be a decent match with two disparate plates of a first course (and the even further disparate second course- yes we informed him of our total meal choices PRIOR to our wine selection).
When we went to dinner here, the place was empty, which should have been a clue.
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!
In Short Take a quick trip to Maine at this classic lobster pound where the outdoor picnic tables are the prime seats in summertime.
Our server was just fantastic, she recommended that we order a lot of different dishes, so we did, we tried almost everything on the menu, we were a party of six and the whole group enjoyed everything.
Great place to meet friends or co workers for drinks, dinner or both.
The chorizo was a memory and sounded better on the menu.
At the end of our meal, I approached the waitress and asked that they not charge us for the $25 appetizer.
we completed our cocktails long before the waiter brought our starters (which did not come until 30 minutes after we had been seated).
Well, the manager rudely informed us that this was how the food is supposed to be served (one course every 30 or so minutes) and then claimed that Oliva is NOT a tapas restaurant.
The singing wait staff are great, the food is just awful!!
After waiting 40 minutes for a table and 30+ for our entrees, our waiter was distracted.
Overall, I good place to take a date or have a small group of friends for dinner.
The service was adequate though we did need to keep asking for water and the drinks from the bar took a long time- plus the restaraurant was not crowded.
I can only speak as a non-Indian, since we both come from an originally American palate, but Indian cuisine, both Northern and Southern, is my favorite non-Western cuisine, and I'm always on the prowl for something delicious and worth the price.
: after ordering a bottle of wine (which was originally, inexplicably mistaken for 2 glasses of it), the (2) waitresses in charge of the outdoor space claimed that the bottle was right there in the only cooler used to service about 10 tables.
The service was very good, although the food was mediocre.
The wait can be long especially during brunch time but worth it.
This was after we told the clueless hostess we only wanted to have drinks, and she seated us at a table.
Even some of the staff that was working that night was served their dinner before my table got our dinner entrees.
better for dining with friends/significant others.
i won't be going back, and i'll tell all my friends not to go--you guys could have the best mussels in the whole world, but that waitress must be keeping a lot of customers away.
The food was so not Shanghai, but apparently those in the crowded dining room and waiting for tables wouldn't know the difference.
I'll give it to Sea; the decor is pretty cool and the food was good, but the service was beyond terrible!
The wine list is good, and overall it is not too expensive, though, and the atmosphere is very dark and brick-covered, much like any damp basement.
Compared to New York prices, the menu seems reasonably priced (it is not cheap like Fridays, but is reasonable compared to top quality food experiences in this city).
We were so excited since I was reading great review of this place, however we were disappointed with the taste of the food.
The food was average; I could have had a better meal at the local pizza place.
While the service and setting were average, the food was excellent.
The waiter was attentive but not overbearing and gave good recommendations on the cocktails.
the waiter never asked if we would like more drinks, we had to flag him down and ask him and then when he brought them he forget two of them.
You should not go to a Brazilian BBQ place and have to chase the waiters and go to the hostess ASKING FOR MEAT.
(dissapointed) Over price for a lunch menu, including the lunch specials(be smart.
At best, it's a mediocre restaurant, forget about the fish variety, I asked for Char (A sushi staple), and received a blank look from the waiter, same fish here as any grocery store.
Half an hour after our appetizer was cleared, the waiter told us it would take more time to get our main courses.
The Scene There's nothing fancy about this joint, where the line for takeout often dwarfs those huddled at the three patio-style tables.
But despite that our dinner took far too long to be served.
The food is decent, average bistro food, the decor is nice, but the service is poor, the waiters always seems to have to many tables andcant keep up with a good services.
I was shocked to have gotten no apology from the management, and to top it off were charged for the drinks we had while patiently waiting for food that never arrived.
the staff were pleasant and easy-going and took time to explain the specials to us as well as answer any questions we might have had.
The first time we went there had been a party of 10 that was just seated and the rest of the tables were all full, so we decided to take the drinks to go.
Besides the food, the ambience reminds one of being in your grannie's dining room.
I have definately found my new favorite place for dinner and with its large bar for hanging out on the weekends.
I came to have dinner with two of my girlfriends on saturday and had an awsome time.
A basic sandwich/burger menu is also served for pre-ice cream nourishment--just always remember to leave room for dessert!!
The waiter became visibly irritated when we didn't want to order any drinks at the start of the evening.
I've been there for lunch many times and the service is always cheerful and efficient.
The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is.
The coffee by the name of the place is delicious and although the space is a bit tight, it's a great place to chat, chill or simply enjoy a great cup of joe.
Food was fresh yet dull, especially for the price ($12-14 appetizers; $22-$27 entrees).
Noodle soup quantities are huge - so don't go for the rest of the menu - the rest are at par with the rest of Chinatown.
our dinner was marred by painfully slow service.
Don't they teach their staff how to pour water or wine?
After arriving for a pre-theatre reservation to find the kitchen closed due to a mechanical failure, the problem was fixed an hour later (after many drinks at the bar, none of which management offered as a concession to the wait) and we were served a very good dinner in time to make the play.
I only saw one waitress for the entire place, and small as it is, she only came to our table to take our order and take away plates, not once asking us if our food was to our liking.
I do not understand how this place can stay in business with its prices and quality of food.
When I go out for dinner which is quite often, I have never encountered such rudeness from a waiter or owner as I did at this smoke filled, tight spaced, cash only restaurant.
Also, overheard gent at the next table complaining to the manager about his food.
The was very little if any seasoning on the meat, and the outsiside has nice sear marks and a rich taste.
The atmosphere could be considered amiable, if you possess roguish frat-boy nostalgia.
5 hour meal (we ordered the tasting menu).
Service was ok, took a while to order even drinks.
Nonetheless, we are looking forward to the next time for more pizza and the great service.
The food was simple but exploded with flavor and the presentation was as if it was out of a cook book.
In fact, you can't really say you've arrived in this town until you've scored a table here and made the pilgrimage to east Harlem for luscious pastas and chicken in vinegar and lemon.
Space is teeny tiny so waiting at the bar meant getting poked and bumped repeatedly, but hostesses were nice and wine selection was ample.
Don't bother looking at a menu- Shrimp cocktail, steak for 1,2,3, or more, creamed spinach and hash browns, and save room for the pecan pie and cheese cake, and don't forget the SCHLAG!!!!
Sure, the hostess can be rude, but when in the mood for authentic Mexican food, there is no better place in NYC, yet.
Though weekend nights and Sunday brunch draw the largest crowds, neighborhood residents master this vegan menu of quinoa-lentil cakes, seitan piccata, and sweet-potato pumpkin pie by popping in daily.
The waitress had zero knowledge about wine, and even knowledge about the dishes they were serving.
The place was extremely busy, and with food like this why not.
The food did not come out on time or together and the waiter never came to explain why.
In my opinion, the bar is not very well laid out, its narrow design makes it hard to meet a group for drinks.
cool new cocktails, amazing apps, we were seated on Chefs Table for dinner ;) All ten of us were extremely comfortable, where the Chef came personally and we had special dishes that were pre-decided by my cousin for his party.
Those of you who are sick of the standard Italian fare will be blown away by the food at Arezzo.
They have recently fired their staff and brought in new people who dont even know how to serve a beer, I might add you are on average paying $6.
I will be back not only because the price was so unbelievable but the atmosphere was just plain COOL and the food was spectacular.
The tables are too close together and it's awkward to get up and down without disturbing the folks next to you, but the food is still the best around.
Appetizers and entrees were merely adequate, but you can't beat the pool room for atmosphere.
We had to ask FIFTEEN TIMES for water, we had no idea what we were eating (due to incomprehensible serving staff), waited 25 minutes after asking for our bill, and were charged a 20% corking fee ON WINE WE BOUGHT THERE.
We ordered whole wheast toast; the waiter didn't bring it until 15 minutes after we had received our brunch.
The average price of a meal (app, entree, 1 drink and tip) is probably around $28.
i was at opia january 5, 2006 we had some drinks, dinner, i have to say that we had me and my friend great time, the staff was listening, the manager knew what he was doing and the food better than ever!!
We get treated very well and before we sit down to our steaks and fried green tomatoes that we love there - we have a few beers at the bar.
Maybe it was because we went during the restaurant week lunch special, but the service was not impressive at all and the food was okay, but not great.
Still the bill was close to $300(with 1 bottle of lower-priced wine).
Been here a few times and food has always been good but service really suffers when it gets crowded.
I could not believe how much food they brought out to the table!
Not only did it take them 45 minutes to serve a salad, when we complained, the manager was abusive, told us to get out and literally started clearing the table while we were still eating.
Get plenty on food for the price.
Dining choices range from three-course, ingredient-themed tasting menus or a regular, seasonal a la carte menu.
The waitress made a mental note about it and brought out a special dessert without being asked.
The drinks are very pricey and small, and the food is ok - but the portion size for the price is outrageous.
Our server paid little attention to refilling our drinks, the runners brought the entrees out less than 1 minute after the appetizer, the server delivered another table's bill to us before we had even had entrees, and my partner's entree has a very noticable hair on his plate.
Go in, take a deep breath and expect great food, fairly priced with just about the worst service in North Jersey!
Upon calling to reserve a table outside for Brunch, the manager requested a cc nbr to secure the table for 6 (I was 8 months pregnant and there was a little baby).
At one point, the waiter told us that he couldn't find our wine!
The service on our visit was absolutely awful - a waiter and two helpers couldn't get our orders right and ignored several pleas for basics such as water and beverage refills and utensils to eat desserts with.
This place is so very nearly achieving, but in the mean time, my advice - eat early elsewhere, then take your seat, order a bottle of wine and enjoy the performance and the ambience.
The mint love letters and spaghettini primi we ordered as entrees were perfection.
Great for those hungover mornings when you need a decent pint and delicious, homemade food that will tide you over for the whole day.
I recently ate Brunch there and was dismayed and dissapointed by the service.
the food sounded good enough on paper, with lots of clever names and interesting choices, but once we bit in, the dishes were all pretty bland.
The portions were kid sized and we spent about $100 a person in cluding wine (4 of us).
We asked for our check (to pay for our drinks and leave), and received the quickest service all evening.
for our entree without a waiter in sight.
the busboys were fantastic -- very attentive when it came to replenishing chips, removing dishes, but I have to say the waitress service was not quite as good.
Although the food was great, the service was so bad that I can't see myself ever returning.
Our waitress was pleasent and patient as we asked about all the various types of sushi.
When I went for sunday brunch, not only was the food bland and cold, they didn't even bother to clear the plates once they brought the bill.
The portions were so small that we still wanted to eat after dinner.
At the end of the meal the waitress asked if we wanted another drink, the after agreeing to have one she stated, actually there's a list of people waiting, can you go next door to the bar.
First of all we ordered a wine from the menu listed as 2000 but the waiter brought the 2001 vintage and tried to pass it off as the 2000.
Great place for dinner or late night for a few drinks and something to eat, the kitchen will be open till 3am.
I have never had a bad meal or service (on a couple of occasions I waited past my reservation time).
The pot pie, pork chop and chicken were cleaned off the plates so well they didn't need washing.
We went again and sat at the bar this time, I had 5 pints of guinness and not one buy-back, I ordered a basket of onion rings and there were about 5 in the basket, the rest was filled with crumbs, the chili was not even edible.
The food was good, but it's not worth the wait--or the lousy service.
It does get crowded with plenty of blue shirted cigar smoking wannabes, so make a reservation.
After hearing all of the specials, you would think they were twice as much as the menu prices (as other places do).
Extremely RUDE servers who intially took our order and never returned with drinks or to see if we required anythign else.
1) Service is very slow and unattentive (10 minutes for our server to come by with our menus and to take our drink order, another 10 to bring the drinks/take our dinner order, you get the idea.
The Scene This stylish, golden-hued noodle house spiffs up a dull stretch of Sixth Avenue with a crowd ranging from Japanese visitors to NYU students taking advantage of full-flavored, sustaining soups at bargain prices.
the waiters had a really hard time remembering to bring drinks, and when they did they were not what was ordered.
It is now nothing but an overpriced establishment that is shamelessly riding on the coat tails of its past.
We arrived at 5:30 and had leave at 7:30 without dessert or coffee because the kitchen took insanely long between courses.
It is so difficult to choose a favorite on the menu, because the bolognese, the salmon, the chicken with mushroom, and the telephono are all too good to rank.
The drinks, served with a little extra in the shaker, anticipate the aptly executed menu, which emphasizes comfort foods of a bygone era--veggies, for example, include crisp Brussels sprouts, shredded beets and bubbling-hot scalloped potatoes.
Needless to say, we weren't suprised when our server told us he never put our appetizer order in.
I ordered chicken vindaloo, the delivery took about an hour, and it cost me $13 with tip.
The atmosphere was wonderful, however the service and food were not.
Don't know about the rest of the food, but the burgers are one of New York's hidden treats.
Yes, hard not to look at the waitresses (and they're really good servers), but as I'm reminded by everyone who knows Hooters, they don't rank anywhere near the girls at the Hooters locations South of the ol' Mason-Dixon.
The drinks were really good- albeit a bit weird served out of baby bottles.
From a solid homey, affordable Italian menu in a warm, exhileratingly crowded location they've gone to a 30$ minimum per person on opera nights with a quality of food and drink that just does not warrant the prices.
The space is a bit cramped and the waitress seemed to avoid eye contact at all costs, however, I would recommend you go just for the food.
for instance, i sat next to this couple who experienced problems with their food and the asked to speak to a manager.
The piano guy isn't there all the time, but when he is it's a great addition to the meal.
The brasserie-style menu remains relatively unchanged, featuring classic bistro choices like frisee salad with bacon, blue cheese and a poached egg, steak tartare, moules and steak frites, and various burgers and sandwiches.
i got a steak special that was way overpriced ($12 more then the steak on the menu and no warning from the waitress) and it was cooked to the wrong temperature.
Service was good throughout the dinner but when it came time to get the check, we waited over 20 min.
One friend had the steak which he didn't care for, but after waiting so long to be seated he was hungry.
The waiter set down my companion's meal and didn't return with my dish for some time.
This set off our critical eye: ceramic bowls having edges higher than the table votives hid the fact that the food was presented cafeteria-style; a rolling-eyed waiter pushing water; the awkward Italian menue gimmick; and the bill.
Ten minutes later the manager relented and dropped off a glass of water with an upturned nose.
they waited to get us water after they took our food orders, which took the waitstaff a long time to do.
After scrunching into the tiny bar area and ordering a drink, I was annoyed but couldn't help but notice the handsome bartender having a tete-a-tete with another French-speaking cutie.
Based on the menu prices, the value of the buffet is made up before you even hit the buffet with the appetizers that are served to the table.
Fried appetizers, tuna steak and other dishes are also available, as well as an assortment of sakes, graphed on the menu according to flavor components.
Our waitress kept forgetting our drinks.
the service was horrible then and the food was decent.
The place is not meant for in house dining, but if you want to grab a meal on the go, this is the perfect choice.
Waitress was nice but didnt know some specials and was alittle off, think she was new.
Yes it's pricey for counter service, sawdust floors and deafening chatter but the pastrami makes it all worth it.
For the prices, the food is decidedly lackluster, and the service, unless you are a regular, can be quite rude.
the waitress never asked us how the food was or if we needed anything.
My complaint was with the service-- our waitress was rather pushy and visibly annoyed when we didn't order appetizers or dessert.
The bartender virtually ignored us while we waited, took 15 minutes to get drinks.
The only saving grace is the sweet tea - but even that isn't worth the wait.
Then the waitress became upset when she returned with the drinks and we didn't stop our conversations quick enough to remind her who had ordered what only 5 minutes prior.
Oh, and kudos to the hostess who appeared out of thin air with extra napkins just moments after a glass of water was knocked over - she's upping the bar on service here.
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
I especially recommend ordering the duck, foie gras, and beef cheeks although it's probably hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.
The noise here is so bad that people entered and left without ordering and they lowered the lights during the dinner.
Sure, the burgers are good, but not good enough to make up for the abominable service and disgusting, filthy atmosphere.
The waiter appeared promptly, took our order, bought us drinks and was never to be seen again.
Our waitress had no clue about the menu and (after we had ordered a bottle of wine) told us the kitchen was closing and stood guard until we ordered.
The brunch entrees were shockingly overpriced, even for the area, and especially given the food quality.
Upon walking in and noticing the exposed red brick wall and the white tableclothes and and huge rack of various wines behind the bar, I felt like I was in a truly authentic Italian restaurant.
Staff wouldn't take no for an answer on pitchers of sangria.
I went here all 4 years that I lived in the area, and being a not-so-loaded student, it was a great place to go for some good sushi and a very pleasant comforting atmosphere.
The portions were very big for appetizers (calimari and fried zucchini) but average for the entrees (chicken marsala, spaghetti w/ meatballs) and very expensive of course.
Then the waiter came back for our food order at 10, and we hadn't received our drinks yet.
Check out the little room with the red seats and candles and get a green dragon saketini - it's worth the NYC cocktail price ($14).
The waiter accidently spilled water on our table, and the manager checked up on our meal periodically and offered us a free after diner drink.
After all that, it is average food at best with huge bill at the end.
However, when our waitress realized her faux pas, an extra glass of wine was sent to our table and all was forgiven.
when I came back for brunch a week or so later, I was told that the marscapone version was no longer being served, because there was a new cook.
The Food Though much of the menu draws from border countries with the likes of pasta, cordon bleu and schnitzel, dishes that involve cheese are best.
D, who can't decide on a single dish, the tapas menu allowed me to express my true culinary self.
We weren't even offered a dinner menu and the waitress didn't even notice that we wanted drinks until after I ordered them from the bar myself.
The food was good overall, but unremarkable given the price.
overall the food we ordered (pancit luglug, chicken adobo, romy's ribs, lumpia shanghai, a bowl of green soup that resembles the polyjuice potion harry potter drank) was not screaming with taste.
On the top of everything at the end of the dinner the waiter gave us the wrong check.
The Food There's a Mediterranean bent to the menu--hummus, babaganoush and stuffed grape leaves are offered, as well as Moroccan chicken and spicy Merguez lamb sausage.
Our food took so long to be served that we nearly missed our curtain.
They brought fresh naan to the table as well as a kind of crepe filled with potatoes that was cooked on a griddle set up by the window.
When we finally ordered our wine, the waitress brought the bottle of wine over with ONE GLASS MISSING - meaning, we'd have to wait even longer for the final glass to arrive - which were all piping hot from the dishwasher.
The last time I was there (last week) our food took a little too long and a manager promptly apologized and offered to comp our desserts (not expected but appreciated).
I called to confirm the reservations on the morning of the lunch and the hostess had the reservations set for 12:30pm which I quickly corrected.
Our waiter was a little stressed and brought a couple things out late and as a result, he apologized graciously and gave us wine on the house to compensate for the delay.
Try the Bocadillos to start and don't forget to order a Mojito from the bar (they're the best!
If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!
For dessert the waiter reccomended his favorite which was a Torreja.
Thanks to waiter I learned so much about wine too.
Each week, Zutto's sushi chef never ceases to amaze me with new concoctions.
sort of crouched in a chair, leaning over a table, while someone did that obnoxious karate chop sort of thing on her back for way too long.
Our waitress forgot to bring me another margarita, but somehow she managed to get it on the bill.
We went to the Sunday brunch, and were pleasantly surprised to find a jazz combo there.
my husband has certain food allergies, and they were 100% accomodating even for the tasting menu which is seven courses for $50 - they even substituted dishes for ones that he couldn't have.
We were given only one waiter for 20 people, and it honestly took over 1/2 an hour to get coffee (I actully went across the street to Dunkin Donuts!)
Service was fine and the food delivered in reasonable time given the crowd, but for the price I was disappointed.
The baked penne came out in a small bowl, burnt with barley any sauce for $18.
Waited for a table, got disgusting martinis at the bar, and sat down.
If you order the platters all of your typical Indian side items are included so it is a good value.
(And the mixed steamed seafood appetizer took *forever* to arrive -- apparently the oysters here are shucked by machine, and they only have one shucker, so if more than one table orders anything off of that section of the menu, you'll be waiting a while.
I came to celebrate finishing my third year of med school and was greatly disappointed by the way I was treated at the door (rude and terse), the food (mediocre), and the ambiance (very loud, crowded, and uncomfortable close to our neighbors despite the large room).
The food is pretty good, but the staff would rather be anywhere than waiting tables at Maison.
Got the scoop on this new hot spot and decided to give it shot for a client dinner.
Between the 6 of us we tried almost everything on the menu and we were all very pleased with our meals.
The waitor never gave us the specials menu (which they gave to a another couple who sat next to us 20 minutes later) and the service was very slow even for the basics (bread and water, for which we had to ask a couple of times).
71 Irving's coffee is not only delicious but also consistently delicious.
i also like their cocktail menu and dessert menu (try the black tea rose ice cream and the coconout waffles).
I love it at lunch time, less expensive, excellent food, awesome people-watching (Hi, Regis who is right next to our table) and really nice and airy in the summertime when they open the windows.
The sandwiches from the take out window are delicious too.
she never once checked on us after serving our drinks, we asked another waitress about our sandwiches, she attempted to check on them but didn't really get an answer.
You're not going there for the decor you're going there for the best freeking pizza on the face of this earth and I garuntee you Dom delivers big time!
We took seats at the bar with 2 amazing bottles of wine (one for the appetizers and one to match the entrees) Monsieur Zucco was very accomodating and kept a sharp eye at filling our glasses at the right time at the right level.
from the hostess to the bartender to the waiter (who told us that we had to leave because the tables needed to be turned around more quickly even though it was a friends engagement dinner).
Our waiter did not come back once to reserve our wine.
45 minutes later our less-than-stellar pizza and their even less-than-stellar gnoccho was dropped at the table; no explanation or apology or attempt to acknowledge the ridiculous wait.
We told the waitress we'd like the fries hot with our main courses but she only ordered more once the rest of the food had arrived so we didn't get them until we were half way through.
We received our food and coffee at the same time, and couldn't get the attention of any waiter to refill our cups.
The service was spotty as a couple of drink orders were forgotten and the waiter didn't really come to check on us.
Once the food came, we could not eat because we did not have the little plates for the soy sauce.
The menu is short and sweet: hamburgers, cheeseburgers and double cheeseburgers, with all-beef patties steam-grilled on a pile of onions and served on square white buns with pickles.
I had the first pasta listed on the menu and it left me craving the taste again for days after.
To elaborate; the menu is written in French but the dishes themselves are something that your - enthusiastic yet talentless boyfriend - might muster up for you, leaving you looking concerned for his love for you.
THe bartendars were right on top of getting us our wine and setting up free blue cheese dip and chips for us.
True, the ambiance is something out of Goodfellas, but it the food and waiters are out of this world!
This has to be the HUGEST steak I've ever seen and the value here is OUTRAGEOUS.
calle ocho is definitely high on my list, the food and mojitos are excellent (the sangria is a miss, flor de sol has much better sangria) but the service leaves much to be desired.
Once we ordered, it took at least 30 minutes to get our food, with our server no where in site.
The Food Skip the menu and head for the restaurant's bountiful and ever-changing vegan buffet for an abundance of affordable servings.
I live about a 1/2 block from Westway and when I want consistantly good food, big portions, great fast service and a step above your average diner food I go there!
However, they do bring you a lot of food for your buck, and despite the unremarkable food it strikes me as a good place to fill up on the cheap for lunch or after a night of drinking.
Waited an hour for the food to come out, couldnt even find the waitress.
The Food The French-Belgian menu is small, and everything on it is satisfyingly savory, such as a simple pot of mussels in a choice of sauces (beer and bacon, creamy mushroom, or white wine-and-garlic broth); beef stewed with beer and prunes; and a juicy croque monsieur.
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
I checked this place out during the blizzard, and was thrilled to discover the $12 early bird price fixe (until 6:30 PM) -- appetizer, entree, dessert, and soda.
Self-important people, please stay at home and cook and dump as much parmesan on as you like.
There are decent selections if you are a seafood person, but not a lot if you aren't!
It took us about 30 minutes to get seated, the burgers came without lettuce, they brougt us the wrong drinks, and the flavor of the burgers were below average.
However when the party was complete we had the other waitress come over who said that we had to order all the food at once and couldnt order just appetizers.
Server was nonexistent; when we flagged her down, she told us that the food was 'being plated' when clearly they were just starting to prepare it.
We were so irritated about how horrible the food was, we didn't stick around to hangout at the bar.
Those appetizers only appeared after we complained to the manager.
When one compares the quality of the food to some of the city's other italian restaurants, and then particularly when one factors in the very reasonable prices here, I feel that this restaurant comes out a winner.
I did not like the place because: -it took the waiter over 20 min to take our order and then over an hour until we got our food.
I was lured in by the fact that they have soy options for almost everything that includes dairy on the menu, as well as tofu subs for eggs; It is hard to find mexican tinged food with an optional vegetarian slant.
On Friday night the busboy was sulky verging on rude; he brought the fries (ordered for the entrees) twice before the appetizers came and then again the minute we'd finished them and looked put out to be asked to take the empty plates away.
I don't even think I would have minded waiting at the bar for over an hour if it weren't so crowded and if they had little tapas for the hungry people forced to wait!
Sure, the waitresses are hot, but you'll have to wait 30 minutes just to get your drinks.
Even when the chef is not in the house, the food and service are right on target.
I chose Guastavinos for my wedding reception dinner (for 19 of us) and planned it through their private dining staff.
The menu was nicely sized with five small plates, eight appetizers and seven entrees.
The Scene This vintage Cuban diner, with white acrylic tables, soft Spanish music humming pleasantly in the background and regulars casually hugging the counter, serves some of the cheapest, tastiest fare in the area.
this guy should work in a dinner ,didn't even know the menu ,he couldn't explain me anythings ,a real nightmare.
He, however, gave great service even though he just brought our food since they didn't have a runner.
No matter what you order, you're almost certain to get so much food you'll be leaving with a doggie bag.
The service was terrible- our waiter was unable to make any recommendations, mumbled the special and failed to check back during the course of our meal.
The handwritten menu makes me think the choices change frequently -- we started with pumpkin fritters and then had bunny rabbit and sea bass cakes.
big chunk of meat(beef short rib).
Nothing on the menu jumped out at me, but when we tasted the chicken and the pork tenderloin.
Took the waiter 10 minutes to get to our table, and another 15 minutes until the coffee I ordered arrived.
Besides, vegetarian or not, there are always ways to liven up food without compromising the healthy aspect.
The raspberry/marscapone-stuffed pancakes are so divine it's actually worth putting up with the rude and incompetent service.
Cheeses get short shrift by waitstaff, who all seem hurried.
You wanna wait a hour for a cramped table to eat mom's macaroni and cheese?
Got a table during restaurant week for lunch and the service was cordial, if slower than usual.
Good food, but they could expand their desert menu.
Zippier palates share sesame-fried lobster spring rolls, shrimp dumplings with citrus soy, and inventive maki, like the smoky and sweet filet mignon-pineapple variety.
The service was professional if somewhat slow, though we didn't mind since it is such a welcoming place to have dinner.
Includes a diverse array of entrees ranging from Boar (prepared in your choice of either the French or Asian tradition), Mussels, or Pad Thai that grace the menu all at once, each one prepared in a distinctly different and delicate sauce.
The food is fantastic, Gourmet comfort food and has gotten progressively better over the past year, as did the service.
The waiter got aggravated when we explained how we wanted our entrees prepared.
We waited an hour for our appetizers, (I suspect the waitress forgot to put in our order because the restaurant was not busy) and then the entrees came at the same time!
Since we had to wait, we decided to get a drink but the bartender ignored us even when we made it known that we would like to order a drinks.
Sure, you can sit back and watch the celebrites pour in, or sit at the bar, and watch true masters create old world sushi, and new world rolls.
Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.
The raw bar that we were served was abyssmal, and our dinners of salmon (mine overcooked) and chicken (hers, very bland) weren't much better.
go there and get really good food, just don't expect to get out of there quickly and when the server comes to your table ask for everything you'll be needing for the rest of the evening.
The service, which was horrendous - they charged us for two appetizers when we asked to split one (when we brought it up, he insisted that the appetizer really did only consist of 2 sliced tomatoes and 1 slice of cheese).
The menu offers a lineup of USDA prime steaks at higher-end prices paired with sides such as crab cakes, fried oysters and onion rings.
I met five of my friends for dinner at Blockheads last Friday night and had a good time.
The only thing I didn't like was the bread that came to the table before dinner.
the place is small but everything else is 'big' in terms of quality variety and smiles of the wait service.
The kitchen finds success with classics like a homemade, cognac-rich duck terrine and well-seasoned steak frites (although the fries tend to be heavily salted).
I went with two friends and had the smores bar - two yummy chocolate chip cookies with marshmallows and chocolate melted between, and they serve it piping hot!
When the manager came over, he accused my friend of offending the chef and continued to argue with her about the dish.
The ambience is stunning and the food is really good, but the portions are RIDICULOUSLY small.
I had oysters for my appetizer and the Turbot with a delicate creamy lemon sauce with a hint of dill for dinner.
fish was fresh enough, but the quality was only so-so (the salmon was especially sinewy).
At any rate, the waiter totally forgot about us and we had to hail him down a couple of times just to get the specials and to order.
I don't claim to know enough about authentic Italian cuisine but the food is good, provided they have the menu item you order.
Still my favorite part of the restaurant and bar adjacent are the drinks.
The decor is nothing great to speak of, but who cares - the food is top notch.
From the opera playing in the background, to Emilio, the owner wishing everyone a good meal, this should be the highest rated Italian restaurant in the city.
The waiter rushed us through the last half of our dinner because they were turning the room into a dance floor.
My first and LAST visit included a waiter telling me We're casual- pour your own wine and then handing me a check with a place for the Captain's tip.
I have dined at JG many times for dinner and lunch over the past two years and both the food and the service is by far the best compared to others in NYC or else where.
I am allergic to certain types of foods and he was very knowledgeable about the menu and brought our drinks and food very fast.
Most laughable moment of night was when waiter offered me a free drink to make up for th 50 minute appetizer wait.
Bartender, should not be taking dinner orders on napkins.
They bring over your favorite beverage before you sit down and while dining you listen to a killer jukebox.
Generally one would have to point out to the waitstaff the beer was flat and ask for another.
Some of the food is the Italian American red-sauce variety - fine if you're stuck in the past, but, there are also a number of very good, far more authentic Italian items at most reasonable prices.
As the night rolls on the place turns into a bar/lounge so the wait staff is constantly rushing you to eat up and move out, not the kind of atmosphere you want for the price you are paying for your entree.
The server came by only once to pour additional wine for the table; the rest of the time, we had to fish the bottle out of the two-table communal bucket ourselves.
The appetizer came out cold and the waiter came and took it to the kitchen.
When we sat down - our waiter did not know what to recommend - neither food nor wine.
If you happen to catch it when no one else is there, sit down at the table, get a tea and try the coconut cake.
There were many helpful people, not only one waiter - kept refilling the water, the wine, asking if everything was okay.
The staff were very friendly, the prices were relatively average, not bad, and the food was great.
We probably would have stuck out the wait if we could have gotten a drink at the bar but apparently it was closed or only for show.
the food isn't spectacular, but I have yet to be disappointed in anything I've been served, and there's a definite attempt by the kitchen to keep the menu fresh and interesting.
The smell was heavenly, and the appearance was great, but the cheese was a little too salty and heavy.
My complaint was the service was not that good but the food made up for it.
There are several specials that change daily, which the servers recite from memory.
The portions for the entrees did make up for it.
The waiter, Momir, was on top of everything the whole time-not to mention entertaining us by constantly hitting on the two blond souther girl sitting at the table next to us-- and the free wine and after dinner espressos were much appreciated.
Full of characters from the neighborhood, it's a fun place to meet up with friends or have a drink at the bar.
For a 4-star restaurant (not to mention a $400 dinner for two), attentive service is expected.
I paid $12 including tax tip for a beef entree with salad, noodles, rice, a fried dumpling, many free appetizers and a glass of ice water.
Ask for the cocktail menu it has a plenty selection of drinks.
It was the WORST Sangria ever, and their house drink has just a shot of Malibu rum, and at a price of $9 you want more than a shot of a 40% alcohol.
Waiters were pretty slow, didnt refill my glass of water until I was about to leave, and I had to ask several times to get the check and the slices of lemon.
Today I placed a lunch order and the guy hung up on me while I was saying thank you!
Yuckity Yuck Yuck  The Burritos were horrible but the Sangria was decent.
Other reviews complain about portions, it's a TASTING menu not a Time's Square buffet.
Dylan Prime is one of an increasingly small number of restaurants in NYC that take reservations for large groups.
who seemed honestly offended that we asked why our table was 45 minutes late; a cold cafeteria room that was clearly designed to intimidate; and haute chinese food that was over-salted to make up for the lack of flavor.
Our appetizers came out the same time as our entree and our waitress disappeared quite frequently.
The waiter brought out the same dish three times during the meal.
Tables are a little cramped, but dinner or lunch for 2 is fine.
Conversation went like this: waiter: presented the steak and said 'Meduim well'
Don't look for sushi on the menu although there's tons of sake and it's served properly.
i took another 45 minutes so i called back the waiter and said that if the food was ready now ill just pay for it.
They took 10 minutes to refill our water, they never asked if we would like another drink, and the waiter was nice but just not efficient.
Prices are reasonable, probably $55/pp with appetizers, main course, dessert and a drink.
I must admit that when my friend said we were going to Astoria for dinner, I expected a diner sytle restaurant, where the decor, food and service would not suffice.
For an appetizer, I had soba in pho-like broth with dumplings, and I already liked the restaurant.
Since the service was so poor, we asked if they could offer any concessions - complimentary drinks?
The appetizers are ok, but the service is slow.
The red sauce had no flavor, the cheese lacked that fresh quality cheese taste you expect from a well-known pizzaria, and the slice overall was really dry.

Small dishes, a bit pricier than you'd pay in Miami or LA, but the atomsphere is on the sexy side (however pared down) and its cozy.
The food was scrumptious-not the usual wedding.

The menu is limited but good with rice paper rolls being a house specialty.
I've heard that if you sit at the sushi bar, you can request rolls, but if you're at a table, the rolls are just the fish wrapped in seaweed with rice (which is still good, but I really love creative rolls).

The upside of the smallish portions is that a good sake can do a better job working over one's date, and you don't leave the table w/ a food coma.
I don't claim that the place as the most authentic, but when you're talking about Southeast Asian street food, which really represents a melting pot of cultures and have slight variation in style for many similarly-named dishes depending where yuo're specifically from, who's to claim what's authentic?

Be prepared to wait for a table - go to the upstairs bar and crack open a bottle of wine, or a nice bottle of Italian beer, and get to know everyone else waiting - who knows, you could be sitting with them for dinner!

The choices on the menu were very limited-discounting raw items, there were practically no appetizers The foie gras de canard was mediocre with a syrupy sauce.
They did a great job on the decor but it seems that the food has gotten a bit less in the quality department, as well as in the portion size!
We decided to order soup (over $6 a bowl), thinking that would be quick, however our waitress then said the soup is OUT OF A CAN and still would be a 20 minute wait since the tickets are processed in order.

I go generally with one friend but on occasion have popped in with more, if a table is not possible, as they are booked solid every night, well, the food and service is just as over-the-top amazing at the bar or in the lounge as it is in the dining room.

When we first walked in, we saw other diners wiping their plates with bread- so we though that the food was good -but we very soon realized that the portions really were so small that you really have to lick your plate clean - afterall, their dinners costs a fortune.

We started with some drinks on the front porch and then continued at our table with a bottle of delicious red wine.
(They even let us bring our own cake for the event, which many restaurants may not allow you too) They food was good as I only sampled so I can't really comment.
Althought the menu is more expensive than your average Mexican restaurant, it is not more expensive than any other hip, increadibly well designed, bar scene and dining room in Manhattan -could be less in fact.
It is expensice, but the portions are big and include a side, salad, nan and rice along with your main meal!

Even with our reservation, they had us waiting at the bar for over an hour.
Perhaps it's early and they will improve but service is VERY slow - took a good 25min for waiter to take our order on both visits and the second time I was one of three tables at a 5:30pm reservation so not like it was busy.
Ive personally tried almost everything on the menu and been amazed at the quality and presentation.
By the time you get to the table, it'll have been WELL worth the wait.
The steak is brought to the table soaked in grease.
17 for a small cup of tea.
Finally, the manager had the audacity to lock the doors, presumably to prevent us from skipping out on the bill, while one of our friends went to an ATM to get cash.
And for families they have high chairs and waiters were really nice to my kid.
Their main chef Louie, makes the oddest specials you will ever see and the portions are quite large.
The wait staff were incredibly attentive, though as a warning, if you like wine, but also a little privacy, this might not be a good idea, since they have the tendency to hover a bit.
When we confronted the hostess, she told us that there were 3 of them and only 2 of us, and that the 3 women had a reservation at 8:30pm.
For appetizers, wine, dinner, desert, great convesation, expect to spend a couple of hours.

The seafood is out of this world and priced accordingly.
One of the managers offered us a seat at the bar to wait for a table, there we had the most amazing empanadas and red sangria.

Come-as-you-are atmosphere, jukebox, value and James behind the bar work as a magnet.
In retrospect, that was kind of foolish, as the portions for dinner were obscene.
The scene is reasonably cool but unworth more than a drink.
05 bar of melted chocolate in a cup.
A bright spot: the server was immeadiately apologetic and whisked problem plates away, and replacements were prompt.
The Food Diners are prompted to order several shareable dishes which, considering the food isn't what's drawing most of the crowd, are surprisingly good.
Everything on the menu is satisfyingly savory, from a simple pot of mussels in a choice of sauces (beer-and-bacon, creamy mushroom, or white-wine-and-garlic broth), to beef stewed with beer and prunes, to a juicy croque-monsieur, and beyond.
Waiting for a table is par for the course.
The server seemed drunk, he forgot mixed up our food with some other table, ignored our requests for more water, drinks etc.

i love this pizza, its not greasy or filled with mounds of cheese, its just fresh tomatoes basil and buffalo mozz.
This place is even good for just drinks after work (nice bar) I am going back there as soon as I get a chance.
Desserts were pleasent enough, if not trying way to hard on presentation, lacking portions and interest.
Our server spilled a drink on the table cloth and it was cleaned up in an instant, no mess, free drinks to compensate, and left us impressed at how seamlessly this was fixed.
If you want to avoid the long lines, arrive at 5:00 PM and have an early dinner.
I agree with the many posters addressing an oppressively aggressive waitstaff, and I'm in particular support of the review directed at Franny's bizarrely adamant refusal to cut pizza (or provide adaquate knives/plates for us to do it ourselves).
Nonetheless, it's an excellent pie -- and don't let the long lines scare you off -- they keep them moving.
5 minutes later the same waitress came back to have us move to the next table so she could seat a party of 4.
In the dim lighting, I thought the portions were impressive and dug in.
The whole table must participate and you have to be willing to let the chef cook for you with no menu.
waiters were very nice, they dont take reservations during the week end, we waited at the bar with some sangria, Very good experience, loud music but we were able to communicate easily, overall i recommand this place to groups and dates,   Will be back more often!
After having the table cleared and recieving fresh warm plates, we shared the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chicken and Lentils.
The server spilled beer on the table when he poured it; he dropped ice cubes for another one of our guests and water everywhere else.
It was more than enough food even though the portions are tiny.
It is a small restaurant so without reservations, there can be a long wait.
Beers on tap were pretty good and we had a great waiter but the food left much to be desired.
The hummus was not flavorful and when we ran out of bread and asked for more, it never came.
That's almost enough to prove its legitimacy to me, but eating there, both for a quick slice and sit-down for pasta with my family has always been a delicious, inexpensive and fun experience.
Then another pleasant surprise - the menu said we had to share the entree for each couple.
I can't imagine how small the fish portion on the $10 lunch menu must be if I got the large one.
Yellowtail tuna carpaccio, lightly dressed with a hint of mint, sings of summer, and crab salad partnered with sweet-hot mango mustard and greens hits all the right flavor notes.
The menu alternates between typical American fare (salads, potato skins, Angus burgers and grilled chicken) and modestly international cuisine like fajitas, wraps and pot stickers.
The menu had some slight twists to conventional upscale Mexican.
For dessert we split the combination platter, which had rather small portions but they were good.
Unfortunately, that lunch can take a loooooong time as the waiters seem to forget food orders, forget drink orders, and forget to refill water glasses.
The Food Recalling an era of calorie-defying decadence--hard liquor, red meat, cigars and mammoth portions--gluttony is the operative word here.
The complete and total rudeness and frustration surrounding this place started with the hostess calling us in the middle of the afternoon asking if we could change our reservation.
Not the most adventurous nor exquisite food, but generous portions (at least, on the 3-course prix fixe) that were faultlessly executed, complemented by a varied wine list ranging from that special bottle for a celebratory splurge to excellent choices under $50.
So are cooked plates: Marinated Kobe beef practically melts on its skewers, soy-buttered scallops collapse with sweet brine and Chawanmushi custard, quivering in eel-soy broth with black truffles and foie gras, is over the top.
Not the ideal spot when you're really hungry -- the plates are tiny and the prices not (like every other upscale tapas place).
The waitress only stopped at our table to take our order and pick up the check.
We got there before our reservation and the seated us quickly.
The Scene Tucked away on the second floor of a small, nondescript Madison Avenue building, Caviar Russe feels more like a private club than a restaurant.
The waiter, of course had no knowledge of the yet to be produced wine list and no wine steward or manager bothered to come by the table to check in.
The only complaints (minor) was a 15 minute wait when we had a 10 PM reservation and the tables are pretty close to one another.
Also, if you order a dinner, plan to have leftovers for the next day because the portions are HUGE, the salad that comes with a meal is large enough to be a meal itself.
Food is decent but portions are so tiny and the whole meal is served on huge plate which makes it look even more ridiculous.
Went to Public last Saturday, couldn't get a table so the lovely host suggested that my partner and I dine at the bar.
Aside from the service being slow, the place was packed w/ a good crowd and music was amazing.
After making reservations almost a month in advance, I was very disappointed to be seated in a secluded area for dinner next to the sushi bar and KITCHEN!!!!!!!
I mean no disrespect to the owner, just constructive criticism - improve the decor and dine-in service, but DON'T change the portions or the recipes.
Although the waitress had clearly our reservation on her book, she told us somebody arrived one minute ago and being first to arrive, he could have our table.
it would be better to place the bar closer to the front of the restaurant and away from the tables.
The hostess failed to inform us of that the restuarnt was hosting a private company party when we made the reservation.
The manager very politely told the drunk man that he could leave and then gave everyone on the resturaunt a free glass of port for having to witness it.
All the dishes that we had at our table were consistently good, although not great (nor poor, either).
Delivery portions are bigger and 2 can easily share 1 entree.
Xunta's tapas dishes were great though a little pricey for small plates.
We had a very nice and entertaining waitress who was very much on top of our table.
Portion was just a bit small compare with other restaurant but the price was lower than usualy as well (7.
Then the huffy hostess when we asked to be seated at a table not directly on-top of another couple.
Other than its impossible reservation (no matter how many months you call in advance, the only available time slots for dinner on a Saturday are always 4:45 or 9:45), Peter Luger is worth the drive over to Brooklyn.
Reservations are no guarantee of prompt seating, have a pre-game drink, pop a xanax and you can handle the drama of having a res and getting no love from the hostess.
They were out of cherry, so we got a few slices of apple and one key lime.
and you have to order through a pane of bulletproof glass, but the fact of the matter is, after a night of hard drinkin', college style, nothing hits the spot like a big box of inexpensive chicken and fries.
Maybe go there for the view, but don't bother eating there, go to the bar.
I am vegetarian - so this review applies only to the veg portion of their menu.
Seconds after we permitted our half-eaten fattened goose livers to be whisked away, our waitress materialized, bearing two cold drinks and the chef's profound apologies for the dish - a completely unneccessary but vastly appreciated gesture.
Remember the 80's when you have to wait 1-2 hours for a table even though you have a reservation + the wait staff treated you like the idiot that you are for paying $2-300 per head for this treatment, then you should definately come to experience this jewel!!
I love the complimentary hot salsa and fresh chips that they put on the table !
After ordering our food was brought to our table very quickly despite the huge crowd.
The Scene Behind the often-fogged windows at this small restaurant is a homey atmosphere, full of smiling employees and Filipino families crowded around simple red tables.
I like to drink a variety of teas, but I've had some here that are really weird that I would avoid next time.
But, as I said, it's a dive bar, so it's not someplace you'd take a high-maintenance individual.
sometimes i've just ordered arepas and empanadas for my meal; other times, i've split a dinner entree and an appetizer with a friend and been satisfied, since the portions are so huge.
my table of four was not totaly neglected, but there was a lag in how promptly we were being served.
Avoid this restaurant on a busy night at all costs -- they have yet to learn how to make the appropriate number of reservations; the front of the house and the managers are amateurs.
When we finally had to see the manager because I had lemon juice spilled on me from the waiter- she even took over 10 minutes to come to the table.
However, another server kept hovering over our table, wanting to take our half-finished plates away.
The Food The versatile Austrian menu, fused with French and American, rewards both high and low-end appetites: rich, cheese-laden onion soup, grilled Gruyere and country ham sandwiches and big-bunned burgers are as satisfying as velvety liver terrine with kumquat-cranberry compote, speck and sausage charcuterie and inexpensive cheese plates.
Not only did they refuse to give me any milk but they charged me full price ($9) for plain udon noodles - no broth, veggies, or meat just wet noodles in a bowl.
When the ice cream cake I ordered didnt hold up in their regular freezers temperature, Giovanny immediately had a server run out and got an identical cake in 15 minutes.
I definitely liked the vibe in the restaurant - the food is good with enough variety to please everyone - i'd say the portions were quite skimpy where it counts - meat whether fish or steak- and for those prices this is very irksome.
At one point, I spilled my water glass--when I informed the waiter of this he said he would clean it up--he never got around to it.
The food had a somewhat elevated price tag but but fair considering the Nobu origin - The cocktails highly recommended including the spide and lobster roll - we were well plated and did not encounter any arragance from the staff - maybe the other student reviewers are used to cafeteria service.
The only bad thing was that the third alien was so friendly and took a lot of time at the other tables, so she didn't come see us.
huuge portions, which made it much easier paying the $350 bill.
I adore Zen Palate - and both the formal upstairs dining room and the crowded, counter-style cafe downstair, have their pros and cons.
The upside of Zen Palate is the open kitchen, which allows you to watch the cooks at work and removes fears of who only knows what the chefs are doing in the back.
This seems to be a big hit and draws a large crowd, so be prepared for a wait.
The Scene Though this looks like any other sushi counter, with purple vinyl booths and a koi pond in the small dining room, there are glimpses of superiority.
Low-fat and low-carb options (such as flatbread) lure in health-conscious diners, while everyone else can sink their teeth into warm, crispy baguettes piled with mesquite chicken or smoked turkey, Philly cheese steaks and more.
I finally cancelled our order, the waiter came back in 5 min with our plates.
Called to complain and the response was well, we didn't charge you for the falafel sandwich we shorted you.
The tasting menu was delivered at a break-neck pace, leaving no time to enjoy the wine or even digest the food.
Needing a sugar fix, my husband and I walked in here to find a wall to wall adornment of delightful confections.
The hostess told me she could accomodate my group without a reservation but we ended up waiting nearly an hour and were seated in the smallest cramped area.
Thought I didn't have reservations, the hostess politely informed me that it would be a 45 minute wait and we were actually seated in 40.
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional.
It's very cheap, food is great you can bring your own bottle of wine (saves sooo much money) The waiters will uncork it bring you glasses too !
The Scene Inconspicuous Bottino is an ideal stop for a light lunch or full dinner while gallery-hopping through Chelsea.
The presentation was clever, and the food tasty however the service that accompanied it was so slow it made us feel neglected.
great trendy spot for a night out but to be honest the food was not worth the cost.
Upstairs they have an entirely separate hostess, as if it was a different restaurant all together, where after being asked once again if we had a reservation we were seated in a small seat, in the corner, of a practically empty room.
Service was a little but flawed, (they brought us beers without the glasses brought the main course out before cleaning off the appetizers) but nothing that would ruin your evening.
I had a party of 9 reservation and was very disappointed at the service.
Expect a crowd while waiting, but they seat quickly.
We had reservations, and so did the strangers, and yet the management claimed the other tables were reserved.
The Scene North Square's discreet, sedate decor appeals to the largley older crowd occupying the dining room whilst a younger set parties in the back bar.
We went out on the town with the idea that we were going to mingle with the in crowd, you know, go to a place where you pay an outrageous cover charge, have to wear all black to fit in, and pay $12 for a watered-down martini, and if you're lucky, have a good time.
When we got there, they refused to seat us because our 4th wasn't there yet-even thought there were only two other people there and we assured them we would order some starters and drinks.
People waiting for tables stand at a drink rail next to large windows which open out over a leafy garden in the summertime.
My friends and I went to dinner last weekend and had a great time.
After sitting at the table with empty glasses for a 1/2 hour, we had to ask the busboys to get us drinks as our waiter was nowhere to be found.
The texture of their flat noodles is something that has to be experienced to understand.
the service was slow took ten mins to get me a glass of water.
Yes, the prices SEEM afordable, but the portions are so small that you end up spending $100+ just to fill 2 people and get a couple drinks.
I asked the waiter to move us to another table because we didn't want to rush our meal.
Like the other Bromberg Brothers establishments, expect the customer is always wrong attitude from the staff along with overpriced wines you never heard of, no bar, tiny waiting area and lousy desserts.
The Scene With its long zinc bar, plush couches and patterned suede walls, the lounge is a swank spot for midtown's cocktail crowd.
The atmosphere was fun and if you sit by the window, there is a lot of people-watching to be had!
Despite talking to the weekday manager on the prior Monday, who gave me a hard time but agreed to make a reservation for me since my group was so big.
The menu consists of a tasting selection, Austrian, traditional American, and the chef's recommended menu.
Also, try to get a seat at the main bar, because I sat at the smaller bar by the entrance and it was getting so crowded with people waiting that it became a bit unpleasant towards to end of the meal.
The sandwiches, platters, and pitzas are top notch too, but I could make a meal just out of their pita bread and babaganoush.

I had dinner with a few of my friends, and it was the best we've had in a long time.

Their bagels have the perfect softness to them, but on the outside there's a bit of crispiness to give it a bit of texture.
The food is average, however the service is way below average (our waiter was a stuttering fool when it came to the specials and left our drinks empty for the majority of the night) The atmostphere is cheesy as well as the crowd.

We happen to walk by, read the menu posted outside they offered a nice selection ranging from citrus salmon, pan seared trout, chicken pot pie, sirlion steak, the fried calamari is out of this world they use a secret ingredient to their dipping sauce.
I have gotten warmer and much friendlier welcome and outstanding service at the other Thai restaurants in the Greenpoint area.
Lastly the waiters and bartender should learn to have argurments in private and not in front of customers.
I won't even wait for an hour and a half when I don't have reservations, but the hostess and the pompous maitre d' just jerked me around and kept on promising me that I'd be the next to be seated.
at the end of the meal the hostess came to us and rudely ask us to leave the table, we were astonished by her attitude.
I love the food here, and although it is pricey, the entree comes with rice, naan, dal, and salad, which makes it worthwhile.

I have eaten here for nearly three years, with firends with family, the service is great attentive and informed, perfect for Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.
After dinner I walked over to the cheese counter -after having been greeted by a rude server, I was shocked to see how dissapointing their cheese selection was: it is miniscule, many of the fresh chevre cheese were more than ready to be tossed, etc.
Our waiter disappeared entirely, our food, when we were finally able to order it, arrived without plates (we had to go and track down a busboy to get them), and when we were finished, we couldn't get the check, even after walking across the restaurant to request it.

The food is above average, though the portions a tad small, even for tapas; but they more than make up for it with their wonderfull mojitos.

I just think the prices are high for the type of food the kitchen turns out as well as the portion sizes.
I used to love the Dog but now its become a metling pot of really undesirable people.
We had reservations and were seated immediately, got a nice table by the window.

Our waitress' visits to our table were few and far between.

The main floor space is lovely, but cavernous (which means *VERY* noisy), so our server was especially patient with us since we couldn't hear each other or her half the time.

Clever decor with lower false ceiling to distinguish the bar area.
When I went in for dinner this Sunday, after a 2 month absence, I noticed their addition of table cloths, which really add to the ambiance and I noticed that their wine list has been expanded.

We arrived at Crema at 7:50 and the hostess advised she had no record of my reservation.
Portions enough for 2 meals.
Fun atmosphere, good beer selection, but meals were skimpy portions on big plates and the service was weak - never had the same server/waitperson come back twice.
not large portions - my boyfriend's entree looked more like an appetizer, and all we got out of the dinner was a $100 tab and hunger for more food.
Try a traditional latin favorite like Arroz con pollo (yellow rice w/ chicken red bell pepper) but meat lovers should definitely not miss out on the churrasco!

The Scene An outing to this ski lodge-sized hot spot, with one of the city's most expansive and popular outdoor patios, feels more like a night spent at a fashion show than dinner at a restaurant--and not just because of the celebrity sightings.
Very cheesy wanna be romantic decor and entertainment, but have some vodka and you want to come right out onto the dance floor and dance the night away to a mix of really bad russian and american disco music.
Few styles of cooking place such an importance on texture--baby eels in a sizzling slick of oil, for example, is nudged just a shade away from pasta by the crackle of tiny bones under your teeth.
The Scene Shun Lee Palace is popular with midtown locals, possibly because the upscale room means you can impress a client and have Chinese for lunch at the same time.
this place was ok I guess since they have karaoke goin' on with a free shot if you sing.
Food was ok, but not worth the 1 hour wait (we sat down an hour after our reservation time) If you are going to make people wait a LONG time, then at least build a bigger bar.
There was a short wait for a table, which we spent at the bar, then we were seated on their patio.

After waiting 40 minutes for a table and 30+ for our entrees, our waiter was distracted.
I can only speak as a non-Indian, since we both come from an originally American palate, but Indian cuisine, both Northern and Southern, is my favorite non-Western cuisine, and I'm always on the prowl for something delicious and worth the price.
: after ordering a bottle of wine (which was originally, inexplicably mistaken for 2 glasses of it), the (2) waitresses in charge of the outdoor space claimed that the bottle was right there in the only cooler used to service about 10 tables.
better for dining with friends/significant others.

In the most beautiful ground floor brownstone setting.
When I go out for dinner which is quite often, I have never encountered such rudeness from a waiter or owner as I did at this smoke filled, tight spaced, cash only restaurant.
Also, overheard gent at the next table complaining to the manager about his food.
The was very little if any seasoning on the meat, and the outsiside has nice sear marks and a rich taste.
Our plates were taken before we finished eating and our waitress sent the hostess to tell us we had to leave to make room for the next table and that we had to pay before we left.
The food was simple but exploded with flavor and the presentation was as if it was out of a cook book.
In fact, you can't really say you've arrived in this town until you've scored a table here and made the pilgrimage to east Harlem for luscious pastas and chicken in vinegar and lemon.

The Server took the order and disappeared for the entire rest of the night until we had to stop him b/c the bus boy knocked over our entire bottle of red wine soaking the white table cloth, the seats and our business suits.
In my opinion, the bar is not very well laid out, its narrow design makes it hard to meet a group for drinks.

We first got a table next to a VERY loud speaker and had no view, but the waiter was kind enough to move us when we asked.
you might have made a reservation, but you will end up waiting for about an hour anyway, so hopefully you'll get a seat at the bar and won't have to stand around.
but when tables began to clear up, it seemed polite to seat us comfortably in the dining area instead of having us twist our backs to talk, perched on bulky high chairs at the bar with no place to put our handbags (which the waiter happened to drop and expose contents later on).
Without reservations on a Friday night at 8:30 I was promptly seated and given top-notch recommendations from both the host and my waiter.
I could not believe how much food they brought out to the table!
The drinks are very pricey and small, and the food is ok - but the portion size for the price is outrageous.
Our server paid little attention to refilling our drinks, the runners brought the entrees out less than 1 minute after the appetizer, the server delivered another table's bill to us before we had even had entrees, and my partner's entree has a very noticable hair on his plate.
The mint love letters and spaghettini primi we ordered as entrees were perfection.
Great for those hungover mornings when you need a decent pint and delicious, homemade food that will tide you over for the whole day.
the food sounded good enough on paper, with lots of clever names and interesting choices, but once we bit in, the dishes were all pretty bland.

The Scene This stylish, golden-hued noodle house spiffs up a dull stretch of Sixth Avenue with a crowd ranging from Japanese visitors to NYU students taking advantage of full-flavored, sustaining soups at bargain prices.

Id say a little better than most Thai Ive eaten, and the menu had an astounding selection, which isnt bad for such a reasonable price.
However the manager, who refused to come to our table to discuss it, said we were wrong (through the poor waitress) and would not replace our bottle.
The drinks were really good- albeit a bit weird served out of baby bottles.
The brasserie-style menu remains relatively unchanged, featuring classic bistro choices like frisee salad with bacon, blue cheese and a poached egg, steak tartare, moules and steak frites, and various burgers and sandwiches.
i got a steak special that was way overpriced ($12 more then the steak on the menu and no warning from the waitress) and it was cooked to the wrong temperature.

Was greeted and seated with no attitude from the host and hostess, despite no reservation.

Our last experience: Waiting for a table at the bar (we always make reservations), the bartender ignored us until my husband intervened with one of the owners.

Upon walking in and noticing the exposed red brick wall and the white tableclothes and and huge rack of various wines behind the bar, I felt like I was in a truly authentic Italian restaurant.
From the outside this place looks cute, however, once inside loud as a disco!
The portions were very big for appetizers (calimari and fried zucchini) but average for the entrees (chicken marsala, spaghetti w/ meatballs) and very expensive of course.
Other than making the grill flame at the beginning our hibatchi chef didnt put on much of a show - no flipping stuff into is hat or our plates - so if that is your thing go to Benihani.
Check out the little room with the red seats and candles and get a green dragon saketini - it's worth the NYC cocktail price ($14).

My mother and I had our chairs bumped over a dozen times by hasty waiters.
However, when our waitress realized her faux pas, an extra glass of wine was sent to our table and all was forgiven.

Our food took so long to be served that we nearly missed our curtain.
They brought fresh naan to the table as well as a kind of crepe filled with potatoes that was cooked on a griddle set up by the window.

There is always a fun and friendly crowd at the bar, mostly locals, if you just want to come by for happy hour.
From the space shuttle trip entrance to mars, to the molecular regenerator exit to earth, it was all an exquisite dining experience.
Service was fine and the food delivered in reasonable time given the crowd, but for the price I was disappointed.
No bread basket for the table, the server came around with a basket and we each got 1 piece of bread.
The baked penne came out in a small bowl, burnt with barley any sauce for $18.
Waited for a table, got disgusting martinis at the bar, and sat down.
If you order the platters all of your typical Indian side items are included so it is a good value.
AND you can still smoke at the outermost area of the patio - the wait staff can't technically serve you there because of the smoking, but if you don't mind walking to the bar to place an order (I don't), it's a great solution for smokers.
The food is pretty good, but the staff would rather be anywhere than waiting tables at Maison.
Got the scoop on this new hot spot and decided to give it shot for a client dinner.

The sandwiches from the take out window are delicious too.
To top it off, when we mentioned it to our lovely waitress, she responded as though it was no big deal along with Well now you know for the next time.

Self-important people, please stay at home and cook and dump as much parmesan on as you like.
They have little booths if you want a little privacy w/ your date~ and they have large tables for families and groups.

I was at Son Cubano a few months ago, and although i was only at the bar (without prior reservations which are a must), i had an awesome time.
The menu was nicely sized with five small plates, eight appetizers and seven entrees.
The Scene This vintage Cuban diner, with white acrylic tables, soft Spanish music humming pleasantly in the background and regulars casually hugging the counter, serves some of the cheapest, tastiest fare in the area.
He, however, gave great service even though he just brought our food since they didn't have a runner.
No matter what you order, you're almost certain to get so much food you'll be leaving with a doggie bag.

You wanna wait a hour for a cramped table to eat mom's macaroni and cheese?
Zippier palates share sesame-fried lobster spring rolls, shrimp dumplings with citrus soy, and inventive maki, like the smoky and sweet filet mignon-pineapple variety.
do not take the reservation at 8pm to begin with, if in reality the management knows that it will be impossible to seat at that time.
go there and get really good food, just don't expect to get out of there quickly and when the server comes to your table ask for everything you'll be needing for the rest of the evening.
I met five of my friends for dinner at Blockheads last Friday night and had a good time.
The only thing I didn't like was the bread that came to the table before dinner.
The ambience is stunning and the food is really good, but the portions are RIDICULOUSLY small.
I had oysters for my appetizer and the Turbot with a delicate creamy lemon sauce with a hint of dill for dinner.
fish was fresh enough, but the quality was only so-so (the salmon was especially sinewy).
From the opera playing in the background, to Emilio, the owner wishing everyone a good meal, this should be the highest rated Italian restaurant in the city.
They bring over your favorite beverage before you sit down and while dining you listen to a killer jukebox.
The server came by only once to pour additional wine for the table; the rest of the time, we had to fish the bottle out of the two-table communal bucket ourselves.
If you happen to catch it when no one else is there, sit down at the table, get a tea and try the coconut cake.

The restaurant is small so ask for seating in the front upstairs (the back, where we were sitting was incredibly hot) or on the first floor.
The smell was heavenly, and the appearance was great, but the cheese was a little too salty and heavy.
So we showed up with our reservations and even though the place stayed pretty empty throughout the night, they seated us right next to the swinging kitchen doors.

The portions for the entrees did make up for it.
The line is long, but the staff keeps it moving and usually everyone is friendly.
The place was busy and had a bohemian feel.
Yuckity Yuck Yuck  The Burritos were horrible but the Sangria was decent.
Other reviews complain about portions, it's a TASTING menu not a Time's Square buffet.
Dylan Prime is one of an increasingly small number of restaurants in NYC that take reservations for large groups.
who seemed honestly offended that we asked why our table was 45 minutes late; a cold cafeteria room that was clearly designed to intimidate; and haute chinese food that was over-salted to make up for the lack of flavor.
Instead of doing so, the manager came to our table and told us he'd be happy to take our orders off if we didn't like the way he ran his restaurant.
The atmosphere is warmly dim and inviting - if you make a reservation, ask for a corner both for extra coziness!

The kids really enjoyed their food and the value on the kids menu is good.
We decided to share order of filet mignon for the table because there was just not enough food.

Small dishes, a bit pricier than you'd pay in Miami or LA, but the atomsphere is on the sexy side (however pared down) and its cozy.
The food was scrumptious-not the usual wedding.
Though the menu includes some unorthodox offerings (a peanut butter roll, for instance), the classics are pure and great--we've never had better sushi anywhere, including Japan.
the waitress came to ask me how my NY Strip was, and I could not give her an answer b/c no one gave me a steak knife.
We were told by the hostess to make sure we were on time for our reservation, which we were, but then they kept us waiting for 15 minutes when we got there.
During the weekend nights, the crowd is full of 20 somethings (in which a few look much younger) and is almost Coyote Ugly style where ladies are dancing all over the bar.
Choices are standard and plentiful: omelettes and egg dishes, pancakes, bagels, muffins, croissants, mini-doughnuts, cookies, etc.
Even with reservations, we had to wait 20 minutes until our server came to take our order, then waited an HOUR 10 minutes for our food!
When I got the bill and saw I was billed separately for each cup of coffee, I asked the waiter if he could do anything since the menu doesn't even list drinks and the manager said no.
After being seated by a very kind, but quite stressed, young lady, we took in the room and menu.
If I had a car, I'd go there more often, but I live 35 blocks away and don't trust carrying pastries home on the bumpy crowded B41 busline.
I've heard that if you sit at the sushi bar, you can request rolls, but if you're at a table, the rolls are just the fish wrapped in seaweed with rice (which is still good, but I really love creative rolls).
The Scene Rows of glass-topped, red-tableclothed tables stretch back to the rear of the brightly lit space, whose white walls hold a few seafaring decorations--a boat painting here, a captain's wheel there.
Service was a tad spotty, but the food was VERY good and the noise never detracted from the dining experience.
Downstairs, with the lighter menu, and uncomfortable seating, is only worthwhile if people watching and the energy of the bar scene is more important to you than the food.
After the bar, they sat us on the side with the wine room with a nice view of everything.
Anyway, I went down on a Wednesday night to see if they had a long wait and the hostess said they had a table to accomodate my party.
i've had better mashed potatoes from a box, and the vegetables were soaked in oil.
There were a few moments during the tasting menu that left me speechless, such as the shrimp in cream sauce, toro with foam, foie gras custard, eggplant in miso and a foie gras kobe beef filet fried ball that brought me to tears.
The place was bustling at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night- we arrived earlier than our reservation and got situated at the bar.
Our waiter was well versed with the menu and provided us with great service, he didn't hover over the table as some servers tend to do in high end restaurants.
Roof: very nice space (although I know 5 other rooftop bars just as good), but the crowd was a bunch of posers and the owner was a tool.
7A is open 24/7 and is great for lunch, brunch or a late night visit after partying all night.

We had a reservation and 2 of us showed up on time and notified the hostess that we were there but the other 2 were running a few minutes late.
My friend and I did have to wait a few minutes for a table, but only because Amanda Hesser (the new NY Times food critic) showed up and, obviously, needed a copious level of attention from the greetings staff.
It might be the best sit down food I've had in the area, so if you are going to the upright citizen brigade, or the garden, it could be just the place for you.
The Food The casual Middle Eastern menu looks familar, but the food--made to order in the open kitchen--is a notch above its peers.
Upon entering, I was impressed by the room while the food on other peoples' tables seemed enticing.
Server's were extremely nice, yet were socializing too much with friends that were having drinks at the bar and it was difficult to get their attention.
And there wasn't much room for the people at the bar to stand either, as the restaurant attempted to squeeze as many tables into the restaurant as they could, forcing those dining to have to shift in their chairs every time a waiter attempted to get by.
its a cool place to come with a bunch of people or with a date for maybe a mild dinner or some drinks.
After requesting to be seated at an empty table, the waitress (who was so terribly burdened when we asked to move from the bar to the table to have dinner) asked us to get up from our seats and wait for a smaller table because a party of 3 just walked in.
The place wasn't at all busy, and we were shown a table in the back, given our menus, and promptly forgotten about.
Be warned that this place can get pretty crowded, though the $3 bloody mary's at the bar and the killer DJ make the wait more than bearable.

Had an after-work drink at the bar with a date, loved the place so much we came back for brunch the next morning.
The kitchen is open and surrounded by bar seating (the only kind of seating), and they have a nice set-up where the waitress stays behind the bar and the chefs deliver your food after you have watched them prepare it.
The atmosphere was nice (tables were a bit too close together) and trendy, but waiters seemed rushed.
There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.
After spending over $500 on a business dinner, a manager knelt down at our table and asked us to quote, wrap it up and move to the bar.

We were able to reserve a spot at the chef tasting bar with Morimoto who actually called in sick that night, but we were still charged full price.
I thought I'd give the new place a try since it had an expanded menu and a more legit look.
However the hostess completely ignored us, we waited 40 min at the bar (even with reservation), our waitress was incredibly uninterested in us (never even offered dessert menus) and the somelier could have taken a look at the label before he made a mistake about his favorite wine.
The Scene Flanked by a diner-style bar on one side and glass cases of sweets on the other, General Store resembles a cozy mom-and-pop rest stop on the way through Pennsylvania Dutch country--minus the cheesy gift shop.
The interior is understated making it special enough to take a date but easy enough to stop in anytime for dinner or snack.
There is a huge line, usually a 45 minute wait; they take no reservations and no tables of more than five people.
The only complaint I have is that the tables for 2 along the booth are very close together so it wasn't as romantic a dinner as we wanted but all in all, we were in our own world, more like in heaven.
Ok the manager did stand at the bar the whole time looking like his wife left him, he lost all his money at the track and had been drinking the rest of the day.

It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.
No bar only a waiting area with about 10 tables where you can have drinks prior to dinner.
although the food was good, the wait was so long; extremely snobby about seating you, we waited 45 min + for our reservation.
We hung out by the bar mostly to ourselves, not an overwelming social crowd, but there were some georgous groups of hipsters looking like it was their meeting up before going out to the clubs (a few of the girls looked like top models), but the vibe was real chill.
There is no bar so therefore no place to wait except the lounge that was packed so after wondering where to stand the hostess grabbed us.
I would recommend going at off-times (before 7 perhaps) to avoid the crowds as it gets packed and there isn't much room by the bar.
Hillarious lighting and ecclectic side dishes make you want to love the place, but the meal on the whole was abyssmal.
The Romano family is very hands on with the father supervising the kitchen and Santo, the son, running the room with a high degree of personal attention.
Forget the phony yuppies of Areos and The Pearl Room, and ENJOY the down home service and OUTSTANDING food here.
I just got back from dinner from this UES hotspot - it is like a home away from home - delicious meals and a salad dressing that sometimes they let me have a tiny container of for my lunch at work salads - the price/ atmosphere/ cocktails (FULL BAR!!!
The decor maybe great for young kids but as an adult this place was an horrible experiance, it didn't bring the kid in me.

Be warned - between the pizza and spumoni the place is packed nightly in the summer.
The small single room--wood panelling, large mirrors, white tablecloths, dim lighting--has few frills.
The staff had apparently booked the room for 2 groups with a 30 minute overlap.
The atmosphere would have been almost perfect if it werent for the fact that we were seat right naext to the noisy kitchen but I guess the speedy service comes with a price.

When I questioned the purpose of waiting on this line, I was asked to leave the bar.
Do not use this place unless you want to waste your money on horrible stale cheese and food, service which takes your drinks away from the table once you've placed it on the table, waiters that eat your desert while its on the table, non working faucets in the bathroom, and overall very unporfessional service and food.

We waited to be seated for about 15-20 minutes for brunch, while it was quite obvious that there were plenty of empty tables right in front of us.
The staff treated me as if I were a celebrity, which I am not and they did not make me feel uncomfortable as a single diner.
I had a 9pm reservation and wound up sitting down closer to 10, but the bar was entertaining enough for the almost-an-hour wait (excellent martinis).
even if you have to wait for a spot at the bar to wait for your table, the music and design of the space create an ambiance that is simultaneously chic and comfortable - something extraordinarily difficult to find in this city.
In Short Despite the tacky Hellenic decor, replete with faux columns and signs of the zodiac carved into plaster walls, this Greek restaurant and bar bursts with authenticity when it comes to menu and atmosphere.
Then we were seated at a large booth and it took the waiter 20 minutes to come back and take our order but I sort of expected that with a new restaurant.

Lost reservations, out of liquor, jam-packed, waiting room, out of wine, sent steak out raw, no choices for dessert, no room to breathe, terrible service, etc.
My meal here was awesome, the appetizers, the bar finger food, the service, the drinks, the entrees of Smoked fish, Lamb salad, Clay pot salmon, Lobster rolls, and the dining room is spectacular.
The place is small, but loaded with plenty of goodies that range from Italian inspired treats to Greek pastries all well prepared.

Seating is limited, so you will probably want to order take-out, but a better take-out pizza you will not find!

They offer a sushi bar with very fresh fish, and the side dishes are excellent.
I live around the corner and I miss the unpretentious and always lovely, Irving on Irving, that used to occupy this space where you didn't need a reservation three weeks in advance to eat dinner after 5:30 and before 11 pm.
In Short It's a bakery, takeout place and cafe all in one, and thanks to dishes prepared using the same ingredients stocked at famed gourmet food emporium, Zabar's, prices and quality are upscale.

I asked one waitress if I could change tables and she didn't say no outright.
Sat at the bar and orderd a few appetizers, the humus and cheese plates along with some calamari - all very tasty.
The ambience was all wrong, the bar opened into the main dining room causing the noise to flow into the room.
Let me count the problems: music so loud it hurt, sticky unclean tables, the waitress took a long time to take our order, and then didn't bring a glass for the beer.
Part of the charm is in the earnest service; part of it is the colorful clientele; but the real charm comes from what emerges from the kitchen.
the wait staff looks like were doing us a favor giving us service and two loud guys at the bar made my evening with my wife quiet miserable.

The space was so fantastic that once we heard they were serving dinner we decided to go one night and try it out.

For Manhattanites like us that are used to pretentious attitudes and expensive tabs, this place is definitely a nice change from the rest of the meatpacking district.
Althought the menu is more expensive than your average Mexican restaurant, it is not more expensive than any other hip, increadibly well designed, bar scene and dining room in Manhattan -could be less in fact.
We weren't sure we'd even get a table,surprisingly the lovely hostess assured us she'd get us in if we gave her 15 minutes in the bar.
Even with our reservation, they had us waiting at the bar for over an hour.
Perhaps it's early and they will improve but service is VERY slow - took a good 25min for waiter to take our order on both visits and the second time I was one of three tables at a 5:30pm reservation so not like it was busy.
was yelling at the rest of the waitstaff audibly enough that I was able to follow his entire tirade from where I sat in the secondary dining room.
It's cheesy, great herbs,good bread and large slices But it's in a very dirty area, good for take out and bring it home kind of place.
I lived next door and loved to go down for a drink at their uplit marble bar under the beautiful lighting or sit by the fireplace when the live band is not playing.
As if the 2 hour wait wasn't bad enough, the host/manager was so busy flirting with attractive female customers, he didn't seem to notice we had been sitting at the bar and we ended up missing his call.
the staff prefers to watch TV in the main dining room infront of their waiting customers then serve their customers.
Perhaps I chose the wrong place, not fully appreciating that another reviewer's remark that diners here won't be rushed could translate to my timely-arrived party having to wait 'til 9:50PM to be seated for a 9PM Saturday reservation.
The staff is cool and friendly, and the place has been around since J.
One of the managers offered us a seat at the bar to wait for a table, there we had the most amazing empanadas and red sangria.
While the design of the space and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable (with a great view of Union Square), the food has once again proved to be less than favorable and the service mediocre.
When the hostess finally appears she tells me that she can't seat us on the mostly empty patio because all the open tables are for dinner not drinks.
If going for lunch, best to go by 12:30, even if getting take-out, the place is tiny and fills up quickly, both with people eating there, and standing waiting for take-out orders.
That was totally acceptable and we found some great seats at the bar.
They were playing top 40 music the day I went which just didn't work with the whole theme, but they had the trippy sci-fi music playing in the bathroom, so it was almost right.

The space and furnishings are too spartan and the service amateur and scattershot (no smiles offered here - busboy serves mains with who gets the.

Last night the dining room was crammed and seemingly only had one waiter which is ludicrous.
The execution in the dining room was on point and we never had any service or food issues.
The food at Mercer Kitchen is great, flavorful and nicely portioned.
The atmosphere is fun -- dark, pulsing, basement room; a place where you feel like you can relax.
There is no service at this bar, which means no drinks or food -- ultimately leading to a very frustrating night out, and you end up kicking yourself for not leaving an hour earlier.
This place is even good for just drinks after work (nice bar) I am going back there as soon as I get a chance.
The Scene There are two distinct personalities to the place: The loud, seemingly always-crowded bar with hanging paper decorations and dim lighting, and the two main dining areas, where the noise level and decor is notably more subdued.
Customers choose flavors like sweet cream, cake batter or banana, add mix-ins--ranging from candy bar chunks and Gummi bears to hot fudge and peanut butter--then servers mash it all together on a frozen slab of granite.
If the food is out of your price range then at least go for happy hour for a drink - although the drinks cost a bit more then the average happy hour bar after you receive one you would agree that it is worth it.
Its the perfect place to take a date, start out with dinner and then stick around for dancing!
Waitstaff is preoccupied dancing on the bar and googling at beautiful people, but who can blame them.
Meanwhile, our server was dancing and posing by the bar.
For the money, it's a dependable and fun place to get sushi - bring friends and share the 2 for 1 rolls (they have to be 2 of the same.
waiters were very nice, they dont take reservations during the week end, we waited at the bar with some sangria, Very good experience, loud music but we were able to communicate easily, overall i recommand this place to groups and dates,   Will be back more often!

Decor is old, but the bathrooms are clean and updated.
The food is worth going for, but the boys in behind the bar in the lounge are what keep me coming back!
too bad that the 2 sushi chefs have become a bit too busy to chat away with the guests at the counter, but they try and hey, we are here for the food !!!
We got up from the bar and got pushy with the hostess and finally were seated at an excellent table.
Atmosphere in the formal room was nice, but the informal dining room was extremely loud which ultimately made the formal room louder than my perference.
The place was small and simple, but I never cared about service or decor.
Additionally the bar upstairs is picturesque and spacious, even though the techno music is horrible.
I think that argentine cuisine can be match more interesting better that the insipid expirience that I had in this overpriced place.
The service was average and the tables are really close together (but who cares when the food is this good).
In Short This restaurant, an offshoot of the celebrity-besieged East Hampton eatery of the same name, is enlivened by a copper-topped bar, an on-display wood-burning oven and a royal blue oceanic mural running along its walls.
They ended up cramming 10 of us on 3 small tables, then taking forever with our food.
If you go in, make sure to listen to the unbelievably loud microphone that the folks at the counter use to dictate orders to the cooks who stand about two feet behind them.
It's called OYSTER BAR, and yet no oyster selection at all!
They kept the chef, margarita machines, and practically the identical menu from Miracle Grill (the restaurant that formerly had the space); how is it that everything here is so much worse?
The food was good, the service was fine, and the place has a lot of visual atmosphere, but I would not go back unless I was stuck eating with someone I didn't want to listen to.
I noticed many of the other comments had negative things to say about the service and food - my thoughts and suggestions are: eat at the bar to avoid a rude waiter or bad service here and Artisanal's reputation is based on the cheese, get the CHEESE and not the steak or whatever.
However, the service has SIGNIFICANTLY declined since they expanded into the back room.
Nice decor - but the place is so crowded and noisy you can't enjoy it.
The only complaints (minor) was a 15 minute wait when we had a 10 PM reservation and the tables are pretty close to one another.
Although we had to wait a long while and the hostess was very busy behind the bar, she was very apologetic and sincere which made it feel ok to have to wait.
The wait staff is very attentive, and you can smoke at the bar while enjoying the view of the river.
Lovely place with the kind of Chinese food I like -- clean presentation, sizeable menu, and a bit of a French twist.
Went to Public last Saturday, couldn't get a table so the lovely host suggested that my partner and I dine at the bar.
I am an extremely low maintenance diner and the staff at this restaurant managed to insult my dinner party and refuse kitchen service minutes after seating us and informing us that the kitchen was open.
Aside from the service being slow, the place was packed w/ a good crowd and music was amazing.
It's got above-average diner and italian fare, and it's right near the subway.
The small bar is always packed with people, and you have to constantly contend with waiters asking you to move as they navigate through the crowd to make it to their tables.
After making reservations almost a month in advance, I was very disappointed to be seated in a secluded area for dinner next to the sushi bar and KITCHEN!!!!!!!
Recommended to those who want to try a different setting for a diner.
Hey - What better excuse to sit at the bar and try another one of their fantastic drinks.
Although there were many open tables, the manager insisted my party wait at the bar for over one hour.
it would be better to place the bar closer to the front of the restaurant and away from the tables.
Don't go for the decor or the location, go for the food!
If I went back, I'd have dinner in the bar--better service and even better atmosphere.
The worst occasion, and the final straw for me was when myself and four friends were told that we could have a table if we moved away from our stools at the bar.

I've eaten at this Zen Palate location a few times, and each time have had the same reaction- I feel the food's sub-par, but decide to give it another chance and order something else.
Diners at the bar watch busy chefs scoop lobster salad onto warm brioche rolls.
A cocky, arrogant and shockingly condescending manager (all of 22 years-old) then told us we should leave the restaurant if we wouldn't move to the bar.
Maybe go there for the view, but don't bother eating there, go to the bar.
Service was prompt, although at times the waiters seemed to be spending more time dealing with the overflow from the bar than the diners (ever heard of cocktail waiters).
My companion went to the bathroom and overheard the waiter singing near the back of the place The cappuccino machine is broken, It's broken.
That being said, they do have a nice lounge area downstairs where you can just hang out, have a seat, and relax (no more waiting out in the cold or at the crowded bar).
While the place looks rather small and undecorated, I will definitely go back just for the food.
Actually, upon being seated in the tea room, we weren't even offered the tea menus and had to ask for it.
The Scene Behind the often-fogged windows at this small restaurant is a homey atmosphere, full of smiling employees and Filipino families crowded around simple red tables.
Sit at the bar, order a glass of wine, and grab an appetizer: they'll also bring you olives, parmesan cheese, a huge loaf of delicious bread and 3 dipping sauces.
But, as I said, it's a dive bar, so it's not someplace you'd take a high-maintenance individual.
Instead of going to a fun lounge after dinner, as planned, everyone had paid so much, that we went to a dive bar for the rest of the night for cheap drinks.
Bar has, french fries, bunch of different vegs and fruits, sushi, ribs (not great, wait for the waiters that come around with the meat).
I went on a Saturday night on the recommendation of the new General Manager, Mike who also did Cheetah Club and Le Souk.
The only bad thing was that the third alien was so friendly and took a lot of time at the other tables, so she didn't come see us.
Unfortunately, as we were finishing up, the manager hovered around us and asked us to go to the bar to finish our drinks because there were other people waiting.
The upside of Zen Palate is the open kitchen, which allows you to watch the cooks at work and removes fears of who only knows what the chefs are doing in the back.
The bar bites weren't anything special (we had calamari and wings, very ordinary), but our dinner was phenomonal, as was our service.
The Scene Though this looks like any other sushi counter, with purple vinyl booths and a koi pond in the small dining room, there are glimpses of superiority.
One of my favorite places to get a cup of tea or to have a casual brunch with the newspaper.
The place was very crowded usually it is a good indication that the food would be worth the delay.
I went back a different night, once again I can't remember which, probably Friday and the place was a ghost town, with a corny DJ and a waitress who couldn't get my friend's drink right after several tries.
My next thought was god i could use a few drinks and a bathroom.
Start by enjoying the atmosphere while having a glass of wine at the bar and we you are ready, go and enjoy your food!

PLUS the best wine can be found in the bar but they refused to sell us a bottle!!
SQC is great in the evening, the light is excellent and it's perfect to sit at the bar, eat oysters on the half shell and have a glass of wine.
With only 2 tables occupied in the whole place, the waitress spent her time behind the bar and only came to help us when we got up and asked her to.
Our apetizers took quite a while to be served, in fact, while all the other tables that sat way after us were being served I asked the waiter what happened to our appetizers, the calamari was tough; The entrees were tasteless and really!, one have to be really bad to mess a simple pasta dish.
Best Baked Ziti in the area, great classic NY pizza.

Much has been made of Island's lack of french fries--space and cost are cited on the menu--but an order of thick crispy salt and vinegar chips almost satisfies the craving.
mapQuest before you go and you'll arrive early enough start off at the bar with a fabulous old school cocktail.
About 10 of us came here for drinks last friday, the atmosphere was good for chatting and hanging out, but not enough lounge or bar space, they should open up the back area w/ more loungable chairs or booths if they want to catch any after dinner sort of bar crowd.
The only thing that was a little annoying was that the hostess didnt want to let us finish our first drinks at the bar and kept rushing us to sit down.
The wait staff is very attentive; though if the place is really packed, then you may have to flag someone.
Like the other Bromberg Brothers establishments, expect the customer is always wrong attitude from the staff along with overpriced wines you never heard of, no bar, tiny waiting area and lousy desserts.

They might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says I love you.

The manager refused to talk to me sending the waiter to tell me to tell me that he was not available, when I had previously seen him doing absolutely nothing at the bar.
And forget about having a drink at the bar to take the edge off because the space between tables is so narrow that you'll be shoved by the wait staff who are desparate to get their job done.
Also, try to get a seat at the main bar, because I sat at the smaller bar by the entrance and it was getting so crowded with people waiting that it became a bit unpleasant towards to end of the meal.
(The band is positioned in front of the windows, in a space roughly the size of a living room.

The party space worked out well for our rehearsal dinner.
I've heard all the complaints about food and staff at this place, and perhaps some people have had an unfortunate encounter with the host or a cranky waiter.
The crowd doesn't disappoint: A well-heeled, fashionable clientele packs the polished-wood-and-glass-partitioned space, settling into one of two dining rooms, or the bar, which is located at the farthest corner from the entrance.
Nice family place, nice atmosphere, but don't go there for pizza.
Service at the bar was fine, just as you would expect.
Our booth style seats would've been more romantic if our waitress, though nice, was less intrusive, and the loud music from its bar didn't filter thru so much.

The smell near the bar is unbearable, the food is so so, nothing out of the norm, just very plan.
A friendly staff works the room, delivering favorites like crisp, crackling spring rolls and shredded pork rolls wrapped in rice paper.
I had to wait 1hr since I got there around 8pm but you could have a few drinks by the bar since the ambiance is very loungy/ club like.
Great when the band is playing, not so great when there's a large party at the bar.
The prices were moderate for fine dining, and although the restaurant is relatively small, it was easy to have a quiet conversation even though the tables are fairly close together.
i ate here with a friend by default-- we were in the meatpacking district on a saturday night, every place in the area was pretty much booked, we were hungry, i only drink sake, and he was treating :).
The place is packed, they don't take reservations and waited almost 2 hours.
A huge Coca-Cola sign dominates the bar, and cute waiters whisk plates of 'cue across the dining room and to the sidewalk patio.
The place has a sort of trendy pseudo-asian decor that seems perfectly casual or romantic.
Place was empty, waitress was rude, told us that even though there were drink specials at the bar (2 for 1 margaritas), we couldn't have them at our table and we couldn't go up to the bar to get drinks.
However, our one and only complaint was when I received my drink I gave my coupon to our waiter, he returned minutes later to tell me that it could not be used in the dining room, only at the lounge or at the bar.
Even when the place has been packed with tables (I saw a party of 12 in there last time), the waiters and bartenders are still nice.
Noisy atmosphere makes the place even more fun, though it may become hard to get in after 5PM on Friday- almost every table would be reserved.
I have gotten warmer and much friendlier welcome and outstanding service at the other Thai restaurants in the Greenpoint area.
Went to Chow Bar for dinner, I thought it was kind of pricey, but the food and the service was good - but it wasn't incredibly busy, so maybe they just had more free time to devote to us.

Then we were led downstairs to the main room, and were seated at the huge communal dining room table.
Our waiter never once asked how everything was, as I suspect he knew the kitchen was producing seriously average food.
We were crammed next to the people who were seated to the right of us, who repeatedly took phone calls during dinner, while the rude wait staff did nothing despite the warning on the menu that cell phones were not to be used in the dining room.
we walked in to the resturant, squeezed by our (to be) waiter (who ignored us and didnt step to the side), and straight up to the host (he was busy talking to the bar tender).

the manager was nice profecional and service was average but the food was not italian, a diner is better, try po'
We waited in the bar area and had an excellent time waiting for dinner with the bartender and staff.
Great place for a first date or dinner with a picky group.
Maybe I've just gotten lucky with seating, but I've never had more than a ten minute wait.
We were put on the wait list, seated in 15 min after a quick drink at the bar and had an incredibly entertaining waiter and dined next to a few regulars who raved.
Our spastic waiter was running around like a chicken with his head cut off, and, thus, slow to take our order, slow to bring us our drinks (they sat on the bar for 5-10 minutes) and slow to get us the water we had to ask for repeatedly.
Sit at the bar and eat here regularly and the sushi chef who is also the owner will hook you up the best cuts of fish.
It is never a ridiculous wait no more than 30 minutes, in the meantime you can chat with your friends and start the week-end off right with a signature drink from the bar!
Sometimes I wish there were a bar to sit at and have a glass of wine, but on the other hand the lack of one allows the place a pleasant sit down sort of feel.
My wife and I had an 8:30 reservation, we show up a few minutes before and the host mumbles something to us about waiting at the bar and they'll tell us when the table is ready.
I had a nice time, place was crowded but the food was very good.
The small wooden bar and counter up front incorporate a wine rack and dessert display.
Overall, cute place with poor service, and even worse food.
My one complaint: Even though we arrived at our reservation time, the host asked us to wait at the bar -- then forgot to seat us (I had to ask).
The place was packed but we were able to get drinks at the bar w/out a problem despite the crowd.
The wait (despite reservation) was 35 minutes (in an over-crowded bar) no apologies whatsoever.
The bar is small so come close to reservation time.
The Scene At this sleek spot on a relatively sparse stretch of Spring Street, regulars belly up to a small bar and greet owner Giorgio DeLuca, of Dean and DeLuca fame, with warm hugs.
First had a cheese platter at the bar and then enjoyed a nice dinner with friends.
No condiments on table or offered, service average, smokey upon arrival as the kitchen is fully exposed and the space very tight.
They have a great selection of wines, and have recently expanded with a Wine Bar around the corner that's accessible through the main dining room.
We sat in the tables in front of the bar and it was a good people watching spot.
Although we didn't have a reservation, my husband and I enjoyed the food and drinks at the kitchen side seating.
The atmosphere is nice - it's all dark wood with the bar in the front.
The place is hip and the decorations funky, but the food is lacking.
if you do though just wait at the bar (yummy drinks!
Great place to go for a lunch date or for coffee after a date.
And like all McNally hot spots, it crackles with energy, particularly from the groups who gather to share a bite in the bar.
The tables are a little too close together, but when the food is this good it's difficult to be distracted.
Stumbled unto this little gem early one saturday afternoon and was thoroughly pleased with the wonderful little backyard.
A terrific place to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner.
Clever decor with lower false ceiling to distinguish the bar area.
This review is based on breakfast/brunch: I called on Saturday for a table the next day (knowing it was unlikely that I'd get one) and the reservations person told me that there were no tables available.
My husband and I sat at the bar, and service was excellent.
i've ordered a cheese plate there, too- the kitchen makes it for you even though it's not on the menu!
Cute decor, but rather small so the dining room can get very smoky if the bar is crowded.
While the bar is expansive, the ceilings are high, the tables are spacious and the plates are oversized, where is the food?
No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.
The drinks are just as expensive as the chain coffee houses.
the setup is cool with pool table and chill area in front and dining on side and back.
We were told by the front door hostess since we didn't have a reservation, it would be about 45mins for a table, but we could wait at the lounge and they would get us when our table was ready.
Went with three people last saturday night - half way through our entrees we tried to order a second bottle of wine - both the hostess and waitress told us no, cause, ehh, the place is very crowded this night guys.
This place is so unexpected, just a tiny little bar, but it serves dinner and even a really good weekend brunch.
this place was ok I guess since they have karaoke goin' on with a free shot if you sing.
Food was ok, but not worth the 1 hour wait (we sat down an hour after our reservation time) If you are going to make people wait a LONG time, then at least build a bigger bar.
We went there just for dinner, and the place was so good we didn't leave.
There was a short wait for a table, which we spent at the bar, then we were seated on their patio.
When we went to dinner here, the place was empty, which should have been a clue.
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!
In Short Take a quick trip to Maine at this classic lobster pound where the outdoor picnic tables are the prime seats in summertime.
We got there a bit early and the staff wasn't ready for us but we didn't mind b/c we got to wait by the beautiful bar.
Great place to meet friends or co workers for drinks, dinner or both.
When I couldn't hear any of my selections in the dining room, the manager told me that the broken speakers in were 'not his fault'
Overall, I good place to take a date or have a small group of friends for dinner.
The service was adequate though we did need to keep asking for water and the drinks from the bar took a long time- plus the restaraurant was not crowded.
: after ordering a bottle of wine (which was originally, inexplicably mistaken for 2 glasses of it), the (2) waitresses in charge of the outdoor space claimed that the bottle was right there in the only cooler used to service about 10 tables.
The decor is worth a mention, with plush seating areas that range from bar stools to table/chair combos to full sofa areas.
I called ahead and was told that there would be no problem seating a party of two at 5:30, arrived at 5:30, was told there would be a 5 to 10 minute wait.
The food was so not Shanghai, but apparently those in the crowded dining room and waiting for tables wouldn't know the difference.
We were so excited since I was reading great review of this place, however we were disappointed with the taste of the food.
The food was average; I could have had a better meal at the local pizza place.
The Scene There's nothing fancy about this joint, where the line for takeout often dwarfs those huddled at the three patio-style tables.
The food is decent, average bistro food, the decor is nice, but the service is poor, the waiters always seems to have to many tables andcant keep up with a good services.
The first time we went there had been a party of 10 that was just seated and the rest of the tables were all full, so we decided to take the drinks to go.
Besides the food, the ambience reminds one of being in your grannie's dining room.
I have definately found my new favorite place for dinner and with its large bar for hanging out on the weekends.
As soon as he sat, a waiter came over not once but twice, the first time to suggest he move to the bar b/c our large booth didn't accomodate an extra person, the second time to insist he move.
The coffee by the name of the place is delicious and although the space is a bit tight, it's a great place to chat, chill or simply enjoy a great cup of joe.
He may be a little hard to take, but he knows how to run a kitchen and put together a creative menu.
After arriving for a pre-theatre reservation to find the kitchen closed due to a mechanical failure, the problem was fixed an hour later (after many drinks at the bar, none of which management offered as a concession to the wait) and we were served a very good dinner in time to make the play.
I only saw one waitress for the entire place, and small as it is, she only came to our table to take our order and take away plates, not once asking us if our food was to our liking.
If you mind waiting for your pie to be made (the wait canbe over an hour, especially for a square pie), I recommend calling ahead and placing your order for pick-up.
Service only so-so -- I saw a lot of wait staff standing around, and at the busiest moment, I watched waiter stroll through the dining room with two plates as if he had all the time in the world.
Space is teeny tiny so waiting at the bar meant getting poked and bumped repeatedly, but hostesses were nice and wine selection was ample.
The Sushi was of the highest caliber, the cut as if a master samurai marks smith was behind the bar, and service, just what you would expect from a fine dining establishment, New York style.
The place was extremely busy, and with food like this why not.
but the wait for seating can be exasperating.
In my opinion, the bar is not very well laid out, its narrow design makes it hard to meet a group for drinks.
I saw a waitress yell at 2 customers for moving a table out a little bit in order to have more seating space.
you might have made a reservation, but you will end up waiting for about an hour anyway, so hopefully you'll get a seat at the bar and won't have to stand around.
but when tables began to clear up, it seemed polite to seat us comfortably in the dining area instead of having us twist our backs to talk, perched on bulky high chairs at the bar with no place to put our handbags (which the waiter happened to drop and expose contents later on).
The tables are too close together and it's awkward to get up and down without disturbing the folks next to you, but the food is still the best around.
We get treated very well and before we sit down to our steaks and fried green tomatoes that we love there - we have a few beers at the bar.
the space is very comfortable - they don't rush you - you don't have a server holding your bill in their hand asking if you'd like anything else.
Wonderful service, not too long a wait for tables, price is right - in a word, go!
Great place for dinner or late night for a few drinks and something to eat, the kitchen will be open till 3am.
We went again and sat at the bar this time, I had 5 pints of guinness and not one buy-back, I ordered a basket of onion rings and there were about 5 in the basket, the rest was filled with crumbs, the chili was not even edible.
they continue to expand their garden space, w/out expanding their kitchen and cannot provide even adequate service.
We arrived at 5:30 and had leave at 7:30 without dessert or coffee because the kitchen took insanely long between courses.
Having dined there over a half-dozen I have tried everything on the menu but depending on what night, time and who is taking your order, be prepared for loud, smokey (it is a bar afterall) and herbed waitstaff.
The space is a bit cramped and the waitress seemed to avoid eye contact at all costs, however, I would recommend you go just for the food.
The place was empty with three waiters working and it still took 15 minutes to bring us menus.
The place is not meant for in house dining, but if you want to grab a meal on the go, this is the perfect choice.
The bar area was fairly crowded but service remained friendly and efficient.
Oh, and kudos to the hostess who appeared out of thin air with extra napkins just moments after a glass of water was knocked over - she's upping the bar on service here.
Our waitress had no clue about the menu and (after we had ordered a bottle of wine) told us the kitchen was closing and stood guard until we ordered.
The brunch entrees were shockingly overpriced, even for the area, and especially given the food quality.
I went here all 4 years that I lived in the area, and being a not-so-loaded student, it was a great place to go for some good sushi and a very pleasant comforting atmosphere.
From the outside this place looks cute, however, once inside loud as a disco!
Try the Bocadillos to start and don't forget to order a Mojito from the bar (they're the best!
If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!
Chef Shea Gallante takes up residence in the former kitchen of Waxman, now walled off from the diners but visible through glass service doors.
There is always a fun and friendly crowd at the bar, mostly locals, if you just want to come by for happy hour.
From the space shuttle trip entrance to mars, to the molecular regenerator exit to earth, it was all an exquisite dining experience.
Waited for a table, got disgusting martinis at the bar, and sat down.
AND you can still smoke at the outermost area of the patio - the wait staff can't technically serve you there because of the smoking, but if you don't mind walking to the bar to place an order (I don't), it's a great solution for smokers.
I came to celebrate finishing my third year of med school and was greatly disappointed by the way I was treated at the door (rude and terse), the food (mediocre), and the ambiance (very loud, crowded, and uncomfortable close to our neighbors despite the large room).
the decor could be a bit better, and if there was a small bar the overall atmosphere would be a bit more inviting (especially for regulars).
In Short The few window-front tables fill quickly, but most customers prefer not to linger in the nondescript space, in favor of taking their Thai food to go, or phoning in for delivery.
Although the restaurant was far from crowded (maybe three tables), service was abysmally slow, to the point that we wondered if the server was trying to avoid us.
We took seats at the bar with 2 amazing bottles of wine (one for the appetizers and one to match the entrees) Monsieur Zucco was very accomodating and kept a sharp eye at filling our glasses at the right time at the right level.
from the hostess to the bartender to the waiter (who told us that we had to leave because the tables needed to be turned around more quickly even though it was a friends engagement dinner).
However, they do bring you a lot of food for your buck, and despite the unremarkable food it strikes me as a good place to fill up on the cheap for lunch or after a night of drinking.
They have little booths if you want a little privacy w/ your date~ and they have large tables for families and groups.
I was at Son Cubano a few months ago, and although i was only at the bar (without prior reservations which are a must), i had an awesome time.
We were so irritated about how horrible the food was, we didn't stick around to hangout at the bar.
And the owner didnt seem to care, she was more interested in talking at the bar than hearing from me.
I don't even think I would have minded waiting at the bar for over an hour if it weren't so crowded and if they had little tapas for the hungry people forced to wait!
The Scene This vintage Cuban diner, with white acrylic tables, soft Spanish music humming pleasantly in the background and regulars casually hugging the counter, serves some of the cheapest, tastiest fare in the area.
The happy hour crowd at the bar was mostly just out of worker blowing off steam.
We made reservations for 6pm on Friday and it was not necessary BUT the place got packed really quick around 7-8pm.
Sure, you can sit back and watch the celebrites pour in, or sit at the bar, and watch true masters create old world sushi, and new world rolls.
Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.
After an hour of waiting at an overcrowded bar with our coats in our hands and no room to move, I approached the host (who never bothered to give us an update throughout our wait) to ask him how much longer, He was incredibly rude and dismissed me with his hand and walked away from me while I was trying to talk to him!
The raw bar that we were served was abyssmal, and our dinners of salmon (mine overcooked) and chicken (hers, very bland) weren't much better.
the place is small but everything else is 'big' in terms of quality variety and smiles of the wait service.
The kitchen finds success with classics like a homemade, cognac-rich duck terrine and well-seasoned steak frites (although the fries tend to be heavily salted).
I went with two friends and had the smores bar - two yummy chocolate chip cookies with marshmallows and chocolate melted between, and they serve it piping hot!
Still my favorite part of the restaurant and bar adjacent are the drinks.
The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.
This is a busy spot from 1130 AM to 130 PM M-F but you never have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table, unless you have a large party, thanks to fast and friendly service provided by the waitstaff and kitchen.
We probably would have stuck out the wait if we could have gotten a drink at the bar but apparently it was closed or only for show.
the food isn't spectacular, but I have yet to be disappointed in anything I've been served, and there's a definite attempt by the kitchen to keep the menu fresh and interesting.
The restaurant is small so ask for seating in the front upstairs (the back, where we were sitting was incredibly hot) or on the first floor.
So we showed up with our reservations and even though the place stayed pretty empty throughout the night, they seated us right next to the swinging kitchen doors.
Full of characters from the neighborhood, it's a fun place to meet up with friends or have a drink at the bar.
wait staff have no room to get to tables because of overflow from bar area, and knocked into the back seats of our table constantly.
The place was busy and had a bohemian feel.
who seemed honestly offended that we asked why our table was 45 minutes late; a cold cafeteria room that was clearly designed to intimidate; and haute chinese food that was over-salted to make up for the lack of flavor.
Tables are a little cramped, but dinner or lunch for 2 is fine.
The atmosphere is warmly dim and inviting - if you make a reservation, ask for a corner both for extra coziness!
When we arrived there was no free table so we waited at the bar for quite a long time.
Well on a friday or sat, i think this place should take reservations as it gets pretty busy.
The Scene This cosmopolitan cousin of the legendary Harry's Bar in Venice is frequented by a wealthy and insouciant crowd, the types who don't bother looking at menu prices when they order.
I must admit that when my friend said we were going to Astoria for dinner, I expected a diner sytle restaurant, where the decor, food and service would not suffice.
The restaurant is loud, the tables are wooden and the service is OK.
Crowded waiting area in entrance forced you to sweat out the wait for a table while standing over other diners.
For an appetizer, I had soba in pho-like broth with dumplings, and I already liked the restaurant.
The space is small and they don't take reservations, but go next door to the bar while you wait and have some very yummy sakatini's that are made with fresh fruit.
A guest from Montana wanted to get a NY Strip Steak while she was here, and New York magazine wrote up Monkey Bar as a good place.
An amazing combination of a place to sit down with the family and have a good time or have a drink at the bar with some friends.
The overpriced food that's supposed to come off as homestyle diner just doesn't work when the atmosphere is supposed to be super cool but the food is super bland.
My friend and I walked in to an over crowded bar and were warned of a 45 minute wait.
The food is pretty good, but after 2 or 3 bad experiences at the restaurant (consistently rude, late with RSVP'd seating), I decided I would only order delivery.
I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again.
During the weekend nights, the crowd is full of 20 somethings (in which a few look much younger) and is almost Coyote Ugly style where ladies are dancing all over the bar.
MeetLESS gives you a dance club w/o the dance floor a restaurant w/ horrendous service and limited menu selections (the ONLY steak is a top sirloin?!!!)
I've heard that if you sit at the sushi bar, you can request rolls, but if you're at a table, the rolls are just the fish wrapped in seaweed with rice (which is still good, but I really love creative rolls).
The Scene Rows of glass-topped, red-tableclothed tables stretch back to the rear of the brightly lit space, whose white walls hold a few seafaring decorations--a boat painting here, a captain's wheel there.
After the bar, they sat us on the side with the wine room with a nice view of everything.
The chef who is a bundle of personality came to tell us all about the special menu for the wine room.
The DJ at the bar kept the place alive.
The place was bustling at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night- we arrived earlier than our reservation and got situated at the bar.
Roof: very nice space (although I know 5 other rooftop bars just as good), but the crowd was a bunch of posers and the owner was a tool.
Bar BQ will knock your socks off with every entree (pulled pork and the ribs -- go full rack, kid, it won't do you wrong) and the homey taste of the sides (love that slaw, them beans, and all that tater salad) matches up perfectly.
Just make sure everyone is in your party is there together or you'll be waiting on the sidewalk or in the cramped bar next door.
There are only 8-10 tables, so you receive a lot of attention from the waiters, which is good.
Though the service might be a little slow, the waitresses are very friendly.
After reading other reviews I was expecting poor service and ambience but was pleasantly surprised by our more than helpful waiter.
Came recommended to us, but we found the food to be so-so, the service good, but we were told we could not order desert since the table we were at had a reservation waiting.
Went for an early V-Day dinner, only to be highly disappointed by the service.
The service is excellent -- the staff is attentive and the waitress was well-informed about the menu.
The final blow was when the waiter brought us the check before we had even finished dessert--never mind that the only reason we were taking a long time to finish the meal was because of the extreme delay in the service of our food.
worst margaritas in town,if you are going to order a battle of (white wine)they served hot.
Although the service can be a bit brusque at times, the food is always good, hearty and hot.
While service is still ok, the food has been not up to par on my last few visits.
After the wine experience, I actually expected worse than what was served.
However, the drinks are very good and this place is alright for brunch, if you don't mind sitting in a very cramped spot and/or waiting on line.
Unfortunately, the food along with the unhelpful service doesn't make up for the atmosphere.
Heck even if they had awful service and atmosphere I would still come to this place for their dumplings, luckly that is not the case.
The food was served promptly and was really hot.
The kitchen is open and surrounded by bar seating (the only kind of seating), and they have a nice set-up where the waitress stays behind the bar and the chefs deliver your food after you have watched them prepare it.
The bar downstairs is a lot of fun, so if you get stuck waiting, just have drink.
We recently had brunch at this establishment with two other couples and I have to say I was majorly dissapointed with the service and how we were treated.
My group got charged an outrageuos $63/person for a family-style dinner, including a 23% tip added for the horrible service.
Perhaps if the owner manager would concentrate more on service then acting as a dj this restaurant would run better.
The decor is sparse and elegant, the service warm (though my waitress was occasionally difficult to find), and the sushi fresh.
Yes, the wait is long and ridiculous as times, especially as you watch others gobble down their food.
Went here for a casual Sunday night dinner at 7:45pm; dinner was served at 10:15pm!
seems everyone ordered sushi there were tons of delivery orders (we can tell as we sat near the back).
Since it's a small place, it's best to get there early for dinner as the wait can be quite long if you don't make a reservation.
There is a huge line, usually a 45 minute wait; they take no reservations and no tables of more than five people.
The wait was much shorter than the hostess quoted, which was great.
Dropped in for a quick bite with a friend -- like the previous reviewer it took more than 15 minutes for any kind of service at all (including getting water) and then another 45 minutes to get a burger (which admittedly was good).
First of all, I think our service person was miffed that we couldn't order much for apps or drinks since we had already started at the bar.
however, we went for lunch and were the only ones eating there and yet the service seemed eager for us to be done and to get out.
Although the service was top notch, all of the food was disappointing: burnt octopus, bland ravioli, odd tasting mint love letters.
The place was packed, but it didn't effect our service or getting our food/drinks promptly.
Spoke with the manager about comping a round, after we had already paid for 2 rounds waiting for the table.
I've never been during the dinner rush, whence I think most of the service complaints originate.
Our dinner took over two hours because of the slow service.
It was my birthday and although they came out with of a bottle of bub, I felt embarrassed about the lack of service.
The food and service was top notch, only the complain is that this place is so small that some seats are not made for a big guy.
Miyagi is my sushi restaurant of choice in the Village; it's never insanely crowded, the service is very sweet (I've never experienced any of the nastiness described in prior reviews), and the tabs are small.
Service is one thing but a restaurant like Craft needs to have much better quality food for the price they charge.
The service was polite, friendly and prompt, the characters walking around entertained the kids but werent intrusive to our meal.
If you've been out partying and have a yen for quality Korean food at 3:00am, there's a table waiting for you at Kang Suh Restaurant.
The bartenders could have been a lot nicer but the drinks they shook up kind of made up for their poor attitude.
there's always people waiting to be seated and the chairs are not comfortable.
Our experience consistently reflected a lazy attitude by the house towards cooking technique and customer care.
service is good although a bit in your face, we were asked every five mins if food was ok, but better that than being ignored.
Gia Lam I' s service is not much better but the food was.
Forget the phony yuppies of Areos and The Pearl Room, and ENJOY the down home service and OUTSTANDING food here.
Food was served very promptly, but our wait for drinks was surprisingly long.
While waiting there was no room for standing and the bar staff and their drinks were horrendous.
The scene is pretty cool and the drinks are OK, but the food and service were pretty weak.
The service was slow (10 minutes for drinks??)
The service was not the greatest, but the place is huge and it has a nice setting.
The service is not very good, but I find that we try Atlantic Grill at least once a year.
The service is ok since it is new and the staff didn't know the food items too well.
We orderes and our food took about 1 hour to get it, after the long wait.
The atmosphere would have been almost perfect if it werent for the fact that we were seat right naext to the noisy kitchen but I guess the speedy service comes with a price.
The service is sweet and attentive, the wine is delicious and the new wine bar around the corner has the most amazing selection, as well as cheeses and tapas.
We had to ask the busboy if bread came with our meal, which it did and we received after waiting about 30 minutes.
We had to request water and chips (tostades) and salsa three times (the third time my date had to go and track down the waitress) before finally being served (by the busser) and the place wasn't even a quarter full.
Great tasting meat, intimate if slightly noisy ambience and the service is slightly less attentive than it could be but is done with charm.
The food was great but the music was loud and hip-hop and the wait was ridiculous and the prices were out of this world.
I had high hopes for this high-ranked wonder, only to be let down by inattentive service doubled by LONG food and drink wait times.
Helpings are HUGE and most come with choice of rice and beans, or salad and plantains.
I was NOT told this before when I made the reservation and explained to the manager RICHARD who has the poorest customer service ever and rude and said he didn't believe me.
This time, the service was decent and the food was mediocre at best.
The advertised unlimited mimosas and bloody marys is too good to be true until you realize that they keep down your drink count because the service is so slow.
We went on a Monday night around 6:30pm and were seated right away in the backroom, which is dimly-lit, casual, cozy--kind of felt like you were sitting in a spacious dining galley of a ship or a cabin.
The service can be lacking at times, but the desserts and overall experience certainly counter this flaw.
When I questioned the purpose of waiting on this line, I was asked to leave the bar.
We were a party of four, and after a long wait, were seated in a freezing corner.
Service was friendly, but not terribly attentive, took 30 minutes after dinner to clear our plates, and another 20 to get our check.
Nothing wrong with the service, either, but don't we all want something more from a dining experience than just average for above-average prices?
We organized a party at this bar and have gotten very poor service.
The ambience and service here are great but the food was really awful.
My water was filled like eight times, good, fast service.
Huge selection of farm roasted coffee served with a smile, absolutely no attitude, and accompanied with the best pastries in Manhattan.
The bartender was skilled, the owners were very friendly, but the wait for my burrito was longer than I would have liked.
Their cappuccino's are served in a generous mug with a bit too much milk and too-sudsy foam.
Went to dinner for a law firm recruiting event, and the service was abysmal.
Showed up last Sunday night with girlfriends and no reservation, host was very helpful finding us a seats at bar after short wait.
This place is decent if you want to hang out with friends (who don't mind paying up) in a low-key atmosphere with good food, but don't mind putting up with sub-par level of service.
The third time, after, an hour and a half of waiting, my friend went up to the host to check the status.
While the food was good, service tried way too hard.
Though the wait may be long because they only have 16 tables it is worth it, and it seems to go by fast after a drink or two at the bar.
Choppy service with a bit of attitude thrown in -when we asked for the restaurant week prix fix menus the aiter made a face.
But what would have been a pleasant experience was spoiled by the attitude and actions of the wait staff and the management.
The food was good but it will not make up for the negligent, rude, condescending and hostile service with the full support of their management we received.
Went with a girlfriend, waited for over an hour while we had drinks, food was ok, service was terrible.
The New Prospect Cafe pretends to be fancy and the prices indicate fancy, but the food is mediocre at best and the service is terrible.
While I love this place, I do recommend going here mostly for lunch or an early dinner because the crowd and long wait can be annoying.
The waiter seemed truly disinterested (he forgot to bring the bread basket and the wine was served after he delivered the entrees.
The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.
About the wait - be prepared to - it isn't just anyplace offering top notch cuisine for about $25 all in.
Great food, but tiny portions and inexcusable service - disorganized, amateurish and definitely overpriced by a long shot.
Minutes turned into an hour-long wait with non-existent standing room.
But wait, it gets even better, the mussels were so fishy that I had the server try one since he had a hard time believing that this was true.
Once the manager loudly referred to the customers patiently waiting at the all-you-can-eat buffet line as 'hungry animals attacking for food'
Overall, the quality of the food won us over, but if there's one thing the management needs to work on, it's service.
The food is delish, you just have to know the manners to consume, if you don't want to be frustrated with the service.
Friendly service, and outdoor seating in the warm months, eases the crush.
It's a place for the owner staff's friends, so if you're not one of them, you're in for a wait.
No table space and one of the angry neighbors decided to take matters into his own hands by throwing a bucket of water out his window and onto the patrons waiting for their tables.
Service is coddling and correct and there's no sense of hurry, so diners linger over a cheese course or a round of liqueurs.
The bartendars are very friendly and at service with you.
The other food they serve is also very good, but the pizza keeps calling me back!
The service was great -- my glass was refilled without having to ask, we were greeted by the manager that day to ask how our food was.
I agree that the wait staff wasn't very friendly, but the service was adequate and our food arrived without too much of a wait.
Service was good, except for a very long gap between appetizers (which came out too quickly) and entree (whick took another 45 minutes to arrive).

The service was only average - even with reservations we waited 40 minutes, and had to ask for our table, which had been ready, the hostess just never bothered to tell us.
I've sampled several other dim sum places here, and none feature the winning combination that Triple 8 offers: reasonable prices, large range of standard _and_ less common dim sum, little/no wait (not like the Mott St.
The meal was improperly served.
Needless to say I will rather go spend $400 on dinner somewhere else wirh better service.
We ordered off the restaurant week menu, which at other establishments means automatic second-rate service, but not here.
Sometimes service was a bit slow, and we had to ask for salads, water, etc a couple of times, but this was all done with good humor and no resentment.
The view is the reason to go to this restaurant, not the food nor the service.
I expected there to be more options for tapas the food was mediocre but the service was pretty good.
Po has the best food in NY, if you don't mind a wait.
also you dont mind waiting because theres such a buzz around the bar it makes you feel like you are out for drinks.

I have been going to this restaurant for years, in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant.

Setting aside the interminable wait for food, the cheese omelet opened up on the way from the kitchen to the table so that when it arrived, it looked like a large yellow pancake with a slab of uncooked cheese sitting in the middle.
If you consider throwing food at your when they remember good service, then go for it.
While they adhere to a certain traditionality in serving their teas; eg: samovar for the russian, chinese tea sets for the green, the food labours under no such restrictions and there is nothing ordinary on the menu.

Get there before 7:30 for dinner or get ready for a really long wait - this place doesn't take reservations.
Space gets kind of crowded in there--because it's so popular--but it's worth the wait because the food is very good.
A very pretty setting to have a meal, but unfortunately the service and food don't match the atmosphere.
that the waiting is horrific but the food is great.
The service isn't spectacular and neither is the ambience, but on a lunch hour, all you're looking for is a satisfied stomach.
The problem is that if you want anything to continue the meal, if you need an extra minute to go over the menu, or if, horrors, you want the check, you might be in for a lengthy wait.
The service can be a bit spotty since they are sometimes busy taking phone orders to attend to the restaurant patrons so make sure you have a lot of time to spare when you go there for dinner.
I find the attitude of the managers to be appallingly superior, and the food below average, at sky-high prices.
Delivery wasn't the fastest, but the food was still hot so I won't complain.
While the food is terrific, you must overlook the often apathetic service, and the sometimes downright rude Manager that seats people.
I went there for a late dinner last night with a friend and the service was aweful.
For the price and quality of the food, the service should have been a lot better than it was.
Great place to get a good fulfilling meal but do not go for ambience or service.
Those waiting inside to get a free table and waitresses carlessly walking by only served to make matters worse.
The servers were prompt and attentive, but the food arrived lukewarm (maybe it was served so quickly because it was pre-cooked and had been sitting out for a while) and was not all that flavorful.
Service was inexcusably, excruciatingly slow- it took more than 30 min to get the first round of drinks, by which point our party was ready to walk out.
We got there early so there wasn't much of a wait -- otherwise, I usually sit at the bar and have a cocktail.

The wait for a table is interminable.

We waited FOREVER on Valentine's Day for our table because their hostess had lost our reservation BUT the food was worthy of the long wait anyway.
Expect to be cramped and you may have to wait a little for your food, but the service is really friendly and helpful.
The price wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt for the poor service, average food, and uninspired menu selections (choice of tiramisu and strawberries with whipped cream for dessert?!
the decor isn't quite like Shun Lee but the service will definitely make up for any shortcoming.
For the cost of the lunch I expected much better service.
I have been a waiter for many years and I can tell you that if bad service is given you at least apologize to the costumer.
And I'm saying that dinner has actually taken about an hour more than it should, just because of the slow service.
Manager couldn't be bothered to come over and acknowledge the mistake.

I sat at the bar to receive faster service, and boy was i wrong!
After a short wait at the bar (which was very crowded), we were seated upstairs at a private table.
Unfortunately it gets very crowded on the weekends, so if you don't mind dining at the bar you can skip the wait for a table.

Food is pretty good but the service is horrific.

After waiting almost an hour for a table (with resies) our waiter told us that they don't have a sommelier because no steakhouse has a sommelier (patently false), and finished with the notion that he had absolutely no idea about any of the wines on the list.
When we got there, the wait was just as everyone here has described, Domenico's process was just as described, but the pizza?
The servers were extremely professional, especially considering the entire room needed to be served at the same time.
never had a bad pizza, the staff has always been friendly, if not overly solicitous, and the only downside is the occasional wait on line outside.
We had a horrible night here stemming from intolerable service, no appologies after our food never came out after waiting longer than an hour and a half, and a plate of crusty bread thrown at us when we asked for their signature corn bread.
We had reservations and when we showed up the manager told us the wait was over 45 mins.
The waiter had a slight attitude and brought our wine aprroximately 10 minutes into our appetizer.

I must start by stating plainly that I love Jeollado, but it is loud, the service is bad, but the rolls are great and it is the best deal (CHEAP) in town.
The food is ok at best, but the service and the uncomfortable accomidations have such a negetive effect, that one can only wonder why they waited so long for so little.
The service was a bit inadequate-and be warned they bring your food as it is ready- so be sure to order apps then after being served order entrees.
The food is worth it, but I suggest you order delivery, so that you don't have to read old issues of Robb Report while you wait forever in a small and hot room.
Take out and delivery is next door and usually will be better if you are looking to get your food faster.
We ate at the bar to avoid waiting for a table.

As we sat waiting for our menus, we started noticing the frowns on the faces of the people around us, watching as patrons tried to flag down waiters without luck, asking for things like water.

Even if their service was not top notch at all times, at least the wait staff was very accommodating and respectful.
While you're standing around for a good half hour waiting for two plain burgers, you're being bumped into by people waiting to be seated because of the narrow passageway leading to the dining area.

The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
They kept us waiting for more than an hour WITH a reservation and WITHOUT an apology.

The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.
We sat at the bar so the service wasn't too bad.
But in my opinion, a great experience doesn't just pertain to food, and an evening of dining is certainly given a bad taste when the service is not up to par.
Service: Below Average, the staff joked stood around in the dinning room joking around with each other.
In April, the service was fair but again, the food was at best only warm.
Yes the wait is dreafully long, the place feels a bit uncomfortable to talk in with your dining partner, but the food is excellent none the less.
The atmosphere couldn't be better, and the service was outstanding -- at the time there were only two people working the entire bar, and we still got taken care of like it was a five star restaurant.

Obviously bz place, greeting was less than welcoming, service was adequate from less than friendly waiters, steak for 2 was anything but spectacular served with sauce that's better suited for seafood than meat.
It's served cold with carmelized onions atop, with mashed potatoes on the side and it's the best darn thing this side of the Hudson.
as of late though(maybe change of ownership)the food quality dropped with the menu change and the service got worse.
The atmosphere is nice, food is really worth it, especially for such prices, but service sucks:  I first ordered 2 different martinis and never got the one I asked for;  they brought the wrong dishes -although it was quick!- and then we had to ask for chopsticks to be able to eat our dishes.
Faux Models/Waiters hustle around the tight spaced restaurant, while the bar is crowded with waiting patrons and dates enjoying a drink.
Anyhow, there were a lot of Japanese people seated at the bar, eating chatting up the chefs, surely that's a good sign of authentic sushi.

The food ranges from okay to delicious and the service varies from great to poor.

Though the service is speedy be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes for the soup dumplings.

If you hate waiting for a table, then get take-out just around the corner next door.
Somewhat agree with the previous reviews about service and the long wait but once seated, the food is well worth it.
Coffee, treats, and the best of eerything.
a drink or two went by, but as we slowly realized our wait had become an hour from the promised 20 min, the server noted upon our inquiry that they recognized and remembered us and would seat us soon- rolling eye look- matched by a tone protesting the uncouth annoyance.
However, it was a very long wait (over 45 min) and I confronted the hostess who stated that she could not find me at the bar and she had seated 6 other parties before me.
Despite reservations, we ended up waiting for 1hr+
The attention to detail whether it's decor or service or menu made us feel fortunate to be part of the Camino Sur dining experience.

Only quibbles are so-so wine service, and while Prix-fixe is reasonable at $68, extra charges for additional dishes/tastings can be high.
I never have to wait a long time to get my food, so it's a great place to go if you're really hungry and/or in a hurry.
The food came out really quick and the service overall was not bad.
The service was good and the price was decent but it wasn't enough to overcome the bland tasting food and the bland decor of the restaurant.

Despite almost flawless service, I had my birthday there for a party of 15 and we were given a private area on the top floor, which was so cold, we had to keep our jackets on throughout the entire meal.
and although the service is a little slow, the lax atmosphere allows you to drink and eat away the afternoon or evening and not even care.
To complain about waiting for a table, etc.
I agree with the other poster who wrote about the service: the waiter challenged every single dish we ordered with a special (I've never had a more money hungry waiter) and after waiting 20 minutes for the check we had to call the manager over; who was unapologetic.
Good atmosphere, the service is so-so and there is a long wait if you don't have reservations.
The bartender ignored us for 10 minutes before asking what we'd like to drink although we were the only people waiting for a table when we walked in.
it did fill up pretty quickly for lunch, but nobody seemed to have to wait too long, and i'm guessing they might be less busy for dinner.
After 10 minutes of waiting, he finally returned to the table and snootily explained to us that the wine he had opened was actually better and more expensive (not yet on the menu, of course), but he would charge us the price of the bottle we had originally ordered.
Room is impressive, but service is slow and taste was almost like fast food.
I took a few clients for lunch and the service was lackluster, food was fair at best, and the prices were outrageous - Don't wast your time with this place !
It's a great place, the terrific service carried out throughout the night as we sat and got some appetizers and then decided to stay for a bottle too!
The service was warm, but it took forever to get the check.
This is a don't miss if you are anywhere close to the area, but if you're going for lunch, be there by noon to avoid a wait.

Still, after all the fuss, the food makes you forget about the wait.
Luckily, I made reservations for our group or else it would have been a long wait.
i have been waiting for 15 mn ( no food menu , no cocktail menu , no one even say hi to me ).
Not the best ambience and the service is sometimes just mediocre, but the quality of the food is incredible.
I have to say that I've been there only during brunch time but the service even though slow, it was good.
The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.
Service is FAST so if you are dining, order entrees after receiving apps.
Service was slow and spotty; had to flag the waiter down many a time to get drink and food orders in.
I had to try the sweet tea, which was served in a plastic cup at room temperture.
If you don't mind interacting with sour-puss employees, then by all means, enjoy the treats at Sweet Melissa.

not only were we waiting for half an hour with reservations, once we got seated we waited another 15+ minutes for the waiter to come and take out drink menu.
They bought the same surly staff, it still took way too long for food, drink, ANY SERVICE and the food is still $ 12.
yes as I sat at the table waiting just under 1 HOUR for my food, i was quite tempted to step across the road for a quick snack.
Forget Brunch- there are usually people waiting outside, although the brunches are delish as well!
The hostess was inefficiently seating people and disappeared for minutes at a time, letting the line grow to 15+ people waiting to put their names on the list.
The only downer was the fruit fondue desert from the prie fixe menu wasn't as good as it looked (the chocolate was runny), and the wait between our salad and main course was too long.
The service was unattentive and the only time she came over was to aggressively push drinks on us.
My advice: go the bathroom at home, and then go to Ginza for EXCELLENT sushi and service.
While the restaurant/space itself isn't so great (somewhat cramped cheesy interior, and the name implies its a burrito take-out place), the service and food outway its few cons.
The service was nice, although our food took longer than usual to arrive because it had been brought to the wrong table and accidently eaten.
Just look at all those people waiting outside to feat in an unadorned space of cramped shared tables?
While waiting for a table, tried to get a drink from a bartender who seemed more interested in arguing with his waiters.

After our disappointing meal and terrible service we asked to speak to the manager (who was sitting alone having a glass of wine) when we were told he was too busy to speak to us!
Well, no secret that a brunch here on Saturday or Sunday will be a long wait - but once you bite into those pancakes, it will have been worth every minute.
I mean Pho Viet Huong is at a good location, but face it, the broth is cloudy and oily -they're supposed to constantly dump the top layer off of the Pho broth, service is ran with attitude who cares about you, I have plenty of other customers to make money off of.
This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.
While the food was good (certainly no Il Mulino) the service was horrendous.
Food and service were very good but prices were a bit high for the portions.

I took 8 clients to lunch and was appaled by the overall service.
12/24/03  Dinner was ok, service was so- so,the worst part was the hostess - we made reservations a month before Christmas Eve for three people, you would think the table would be large enough for all three of us.
You can't fault them for serving up some pretty good food, even if it's a bit overpriced.
My friends and I dropped by on a Sunday, and there was absolutely NO SERVICE (the supposed only female bartender even told us there was no one else but her, and given that there were people in there waiting to dine and drink, that was ridicoulas!
The calamari, the penne and vodka sauce, the friendly service the parking and the open area kitchen to see all the action in the making!
I've never been able to find a lunch place in the midtown with the same quality and service, until now.
It was worth the wait , an hour, without a reservation, for an out of this world meal.
Service was unbelievably on target down to the smallest detail; our waiter invited us to sample a new desert under consideration for their menu and a new line of ice wines.
A 3 course-meal took 2 1/2 hours, including 20 - 30 minutes waiting to get the check after dessert.

The service has always been outstanding and even when we didn't have a reservation they worked something out, where I agreed to keep our meal to just eating.
The service was good, but not excellent; however, the waiter was initially huffy with me when my guest was only 5 minutes late, threatening to make me move!
Warning Service is decent, but it takes forever to get the check.
Good food, but bad service.
We had to wait an hour before our food was served, then another hour inbetween courses, all the while whilst the staff were naughtily hiding in an attempt to avoid our 'where's out food?'
The Kitchen is only separated from its patrons by glass is immaculate and the service is undeniable heartfelt.
The service was good enough for a crowded place.
They are negligent in alerting customers when an order is ready - you could end up waiting for half an hour while your food is sitting on their counter getting cold.
We were the only two people sitting out front and the waiter was unable to provide us with attentive service OR our dinner.
Aside from that, the service is adequate (visible, and will help you if you ask, but lack initiative), and the food, well, could be a lot worse.
I highly suggest you make reservations, as wait times can be extremely long.
I will have to say the food was good and the chance to sample wines not often found in other restaurants was a positive but the abyssmal service left a bad taste.
And the service is unbearable - I waited for ages to get my drink, got the wrong sushi order, and had my appetizer whisked away prematurely.

The space was unique (even though looking out the skylight windows on a tenament was a bit odd) and the service, happily, was fine.
Prompt local delivery, minimal seating and counter space.
This is one of my first dining experiences in NYC when I first moved here 10 years ago, and although Hudson Corner is consistently good, it has gone downhill over the years in both food quality and service!
Even as a stranger, the service at the bar was excellent as was the wait staff who continuously checked back to see if I was okay while waiting for my party.
The service was fine, out appitizers took forever to come out, and then they dumped the rest of the food on us, without giving us a chance to enjoy our appitizers.
The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.
Service was good except the waitress brought over the check before I asked her.
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
since it looks like everyone's already familiar with the rude hostess and long wait for a table (even with a reservation), i'll skip that part.
Service was slow and our drink order took forever (and the place wasn't crowded).
The food here is consistently good - the service is not - but it seems that they're getting busier than they can handle, good for them, bad for guests.
The food is on the good side but not so terrific to compensate the bad service, crammed tiny-tables, dirty glasses, overly loud music, which is good for the bar part of the establishment but not when you want to seat down, eat and have a normal conversation at normal volume.
I sometimes go here when in the area and though the food is always great, the Basil Chicken and Shrimp Tempura roll in particular, the service has much to be desired.
I though the service could have been better, the staff are not experience enough to know how to make the drinks without reading the instructions.
I don't understand the other negative reviews of the service because we had amazing waiter.
It was well past 8 pm when they finally got us the check, and we asked for free rounds of champagne to compensate for the poor service (since the wine dinner had started, and were denied.
) And don't forget the svc, those waiters stare at you your entire meal, just waiting for you to put your fork down and they snatch the plate away in a second.
True, the service is hardly on par with the finer restaurants in NYC, but I go for the energy and the tasty tapas-like seafood treats that are perfect with beer or sake.
The wait for brunch is kinda long (what can you say?
The Captain was showing his impatience for a crowded Monday night and the dinner I was served was not prepared the way he told me it would be.
Beautiful rooms filled with beautiful people, but expensive for what it is ($68 prix fixe), limited menu, tiny portions, reeeeeeeally slow service, undercooked potatoes with the cod, less than fascinating desserts.
If you're tired of the long waits for table at nearby place, then head to Moutarde for a delicious meal that won't keep you waiting.
-4 waiters bustling around though no table was actually being helped -25 minutes to take our order -15 minutes to get the drinks we order -another 20 minutes to get our food -NO apology from the waiter In between our lunch, a man burst out shouting in anger at the lousy service (he asked for ketchup 20 minutes ago and never got it).
We didn't have reservations, and showing up at 8:45 we were told it would be about an hour wait.
but no reservations makes for a very long wait, usually of an hour.
And the waitstaff has very little knowledge of the food, they served me the wrong dish and no one could identify what it was that they gave me, someone said pork chop, someone said lamb, and then they insisted it should be fine since it was the same price.
When the food came, it was almost good, but the lack of AC, bad service, and overall apathetic staff, from the HOST, to the MANAGER to the WAITER, ruined the experience.
Service was a little slow, but going on a Monday night during the Brooklyn Restaurant Week, where 20 bucks each got a friend and I appetizer, entree, and dessert was phenomenal.

Nonetheless, our waiter gave us prompt service and a smile every time he came over to take an order, bring us drinks, or check up on how we were doing.
i went on a thurs night and it was a bit loud due to the many businessmen eating their dinner, but the food and service more than outdid the lack of peaceful dining.
I went to the tasting before Nobu opened and the menu and service has greatly improved since then.
It would have been nice to find that out on the website but it took us an hour of waiting for Godot before calling and being told the news that no lunch was prepared for us.
I realize that this place has a huge menu and, therefore, will have some not-so-good things, but it's the rudeness of the service that gets to me.
Excellent Steaks, the attitude of the Servers could be a little better but the food makes up for everything.
It's sad that everything about this place was great (even the service and decor) except for the steak.
the sushi is so-so, the 70s orange-themed atmosphere is 2000ish, and there is no reason for the staff's attitude.
the service was very slow and his knowledge of the menu wasnt that good.
Service was bad enough that we decided to head out after the first round of drinks.
If you live downtown, definitely grab one of their menus, make a phone call and relax in front of the tv while they pound the pavement to get to you (although they do take about 45 minutes on average to get to you)-- the in restaurant service is likewise very very good.
The 'people watching' and table location (on boardwalk) made up for the rude service.
If you are looking for service and all the frills $$$ - Il Mulino is the best for both - if you are looking for a fabulous dinner in/out - this restaurant is it!
I made the mistake of coming here with 5 friends for brunch so the wait was extremely long and then we got stuck at the only table big enough for 6 (downstairs near the bathroom away from all of the other patrons) so that was dissapointing but I will be back soon with 1 or 2 friends.
Lost reservations, out of liquor, jam-packed, waiting room, out of wine, sent steak out raw, no choices for dessert, no room to breathe, terrible service, etc.
Although we were seated 35 minutes after our reservation the service from then on was outstanding.
My meal here was awesome, the appetizers, the bar finger food, the service, the drinks, the entrees of Smoked fish, Lamb salad, Clay pot salmon, Lobster rolls, and the dining room is spectacular.
The pizza is thet always fresh and just made they hav an outdoor seating area that is partially covered they also have a full service restaurant on the premises they make everything on premises.
If you had good service there, try to get your waiter's name and request him/her by name the next time.
If you are a person who wants perfect service, you should probably skip it, you may wait for your server to sing a song before you get your drinks but that is half the fun.
Casual and kid-friendly, the red-and-gold colored restaurants offer quick drive-thru or dine-in service with a menu of burgers, sandwiches and more.
Overall, the food makes up for what is missing in the ambience and service.
When I was there with a friend the waiter who served us was pretty friendly.
The retaurant is know for the long wait but they do take reservation for group of 5-8 people, so it was just perfect for my friend BD dinner for 3 couples.
since we're informed its service isslow we had dinner in midtownwent for dessertb-day thing.
However service was quite slow for a lunch hour.
(We did make reservations, since we had a group of 8, but had a short wait when arriving a little early.
We are laidback diners and as we've both waited tables, we tend to be forgiving of irregular service.
It gets crazy busy like any other bar on the weekends, so don't go there on a busy night if your looking for a quiete dinner party or fine dining service.
The service may be a little slow (what can you expect in this laid back atmosphere), but a Sunday brunch is a rewarding experience.
Get in before peak dinner time (7-8 PM) to avoid harried service.
My date knew the waiters from years of dining here, so we were treated like royalty.
It had not been made fresh at the bar, but kept in the freezer till we ordered, they also forgot our soup, kept us waiting for the frozen sushi for close to an hour.
The waitress had an ongoing diatribe with a waiter the whole time she served us-it was ALL BAD!!
Food was good, but not worth the wait.
The service was rather slow but our waiter was very pleasant and obliging.
I don't usually go there over the weekends or during prime dinner hours--but for a weekday dinner it's great, and I've never had any problems with crowds, waiting, or bad service.
People were leaving because they had been waiting for hours, however we decided to stay and have a complimentary drink at the bar which was absoloutely beautiful along with the view, the only plus.
Overall,it's a good place to have dinner and hang out if you do not mind waiting for food,weird music and rude manager.
The chips and salsa are good, but the meal is not worth the wait.
The wait could be long because of the limited number of seats but it is worth it, especially if you leave your cell phone # with them and go off for a drink at any one fo the excellent bars nearby, like lokie, great lake, etc.
Aperitif was the Casablanca; it was served carelessly with ice chunks large enough to sink the Titanic.
The strong suit of this place is the decor, alas we was seated and served by some guy who looked like he was out of a seedy 70's porn movie and everything went downhill after.
the service was somewhat spotty, but we were rewarded with free drinks and the waiters were all sweet and lovely, genuinely french-speaking but not snooty!
No extra pickles, no AC, no ice water, slow service, the whole thing was just dissapointing.
It was not the mistake of the frozen lasagna, it was the icy service of the manager which has spoiled this restaurant for me.
We had to ask for bread after 45 minutes and even though our waiter was GREAT, he had to ask the stiff manager to comp us a round of drinks for waiting so long.
The wait time for food can be long, so don't dine here if you're in a hurry.
If you can't tolerate slow service at a pizza place, then spend more money elsewhere.
And then he'll forget to bring your drink every time you order one, won't pay attention to your table of 8, will give you unwarranted attitude, and never be friendly or smile.
complaints were shrugged off and service was slow, causing the dinner to go on for over 2 hours.
Once seated, there was no waitress to give us our menus.
I go generally with one friend but on occasion have popped in with more, if a table is not possible, as they are booked solid every night, well, the food and service is just as over-the-top amazing at the bar or in the lounge as it is in the dining room.
While the decor is a bit bland--a white room with a few fake palm trees and thatched roof--the service is fast and friendly.
Service during dinner was alright, but one's perception to a restaurant usually starts from the very beginning: the entrance.
The food, congeniality, and service have all deteriorated overf the past few years and so the wait is not worth it.
service, one would be overpaying for the experience and for the food.
When the bill came, both appetizers were charged even though we had one bite of the first and it should not have served competely overcooked.
The only drawback was slow service, but the food and ambience are so nice that your wait is A) pleasant and B) worth it.
why go there to deal with staffs' attitude and eat bad food?
They don't offer recommendations, take a long time with drink orders, don't check back after serving the entree, and plan on waiting a long time for the check.
Coffee served without sugar/milk and took more than 10 min to catch the waiter to ask for it.
The service was non-existant, the manager spent all of his time at the bar.
About a half hour wait with reservations.
We stumbled onto this diamond in the rough after our dinner plans at Schiller's were thwarted by a 90 minute wait.
Party of 4 after a Sunday matinee, no reservation, seated promtply, but service was slow.
The service is disorganised, no one gave us a menu for 15 mins once we were seated, but after that it went smoothly enough but no where near the stella performance of many half as pretensious restaurants.
The whole fish was excellent--not overcooked and served in a light tomato broth.
Too bad the food and service aren't nearly as nice as the decor.
In all cases, service is slow but it's not the waiters fault.
Horrible service, below average cuisine, asked to leave the table before finishing our wine, and forced to have our port at the bar.
Each dish is carefully prepared and is a tribute to the ingredients being served.
My only quibbles are service - which was confused (we waited 10 minutes for menus), and the wine list, which is over-the-top expensive.
Part of the charm is in the earnest service; part of it is the colorful clientele; but the real charm comes from what emerges from the kitchen.
the wait staff looks like were doing us a favor giving us service and two loud guys at the bar made my evening with my wife quiet miserable.
The best tasting pizza by far, a long long wait for service but well worth it.
My dining experience with friends started off very badly - 40 minute wait WITH a reservation and having to repeatedly ask for bread and water - but ended on a better note.
We have been waiting for months for a 8pm reservation at this very average restaurant.
At first I was shocked by the price, but the excellent and friendly service from our waiter Jack was great and the duck salad was the best ever.
Came here for a b-day and ended up waiting so long even for a reservation.
i think friends coffee shop makes great food the service is great and they are very poilte i think that they should open more because there the best food store i ever ate from the food is addicting and you cant stop eating because it so delious.
The ravioli was the better of the two, but the serving was tiny, and the skin a bit rubbery.
The service was horrible- the 'manager' took my our order - did not write it down- and two of us were given the wrong apps and or entrees.
On the menu says Free delivery (Minimun order $10) but I was charged a couple of dollars on both opportunities.
While the recently added outdoor seating was what drew me and my friend to the restaurant, the food, service and overall experience were what drove us out!
We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in thier food in evident.
After some good food and spotty service, my friends and I were surprised to get a bill that had a 20% tip included post-tax.
If you can get service, you might enjoy the surroundings- especially the upstairs lounge.
I for one do not plan to go back, there are many other places in Manhattan that have just as good food if not better, at the same prices with much better service.
The decor there is nothing special, though somehow the service manages to deal with the large crowds in an efficient, friendly manner.
I've since been back for a regular dining night out, it was packed and I should have made a reservation (the wait was a little long).
one of us still had wine, so the others tried to order dessert drinks, but the owner told us no because there were people waiting and the waiter said if he served us more he would be fired.
you may have to wait a bit for service but you will not be disappointed with the food.
I went there about three times, one for dinner on a sunday evening which is a salsa night after dinning, the service was slow and a bit rude, the plates average some shrimp octopus and empanadas.
I've been here several times for Sunday brunch now - (note: it helps if you're a late riser as I find the wait is always reasonable if you show up after 3pm).
Sushi is consistently fresh, service pleasant Sushi rice is a bit hard.
The new server we had was surprisingly well-versed on the menu and gave really solid service.
the solitary waitress was friendly though i found her service a little slow.
The bar was so crowded there was no point in ordering a drink, and when we were finally seated we got no service at all for 20 minutes.
The Scene Service bustles through the energetic, sprawling space with the precision of expert merengue dancers, and everyone else goes along with the flow suggested by the tall, curving ceilings.
But the place is so great that patrons don't mind waiting outside rather than go to another restaurant which you can find at least 10 in short walking distance.
After waiting for 90 minutes, the host gave away our table to a couple who arrived after us.
The desserts were both essentially the same, and the service was on the slow side.
For Manhattanites like us that are used to pretentious attitudes and expensive tabs, this place is definitely a nice change from the rest of the meatpacking district.
Tried it again for brunch, when the service was worse.
Even with our reservation, they had us waiting at the bar for over an hour.
Perhaps it's early and they will improve but service is VERY slow - took a good 25min for waiter to take our order on both visits and the second time I was one of three tables at a 5:30pm reservation so not like it was busy.
By the time you get to the table, it'll have been WELL worth the wait.
Teenie weenie overpriced appetizers were served at an agonizingly slow pace, one at a time 30 minutes between each.
I had one of the worst service experiences in memory having the prix fix brunch there--waving arms, calling, asking two or three times for everything from coffee to the check.
The service sucks every time, but the food is usually tasty, even though the menu leans toward the boring and expected of French fare.
The service was average - the waiter did not check in on our meals and did not even refill the water, but was a bit pushy on desert (we both ordered schnapps).
Service is wonderful- I've sat there for over 3 hours at dinner and never felt rushed to leave.
But then there's the sluggish and absentminded service: twice someone tried to serve us something for another table and it took a long time to get our check.
One of the managers offered us a seat at the bar to wait for a table, there we had the most amazing empanadas and red sangria.
While the design of the space and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable (with a great view of Union Square), the food has once again proved to be less than favorable and the service mediocre.
That said, I made sure to pay before we had coffee, so that the server was not waiting on us to pay; and I left a 30% tip, knowing we'd be there for a while.
If going for lunch, best to go by 12:30, even if getting take-out, the place is tiny and fills up quickly, both with people eating there, and standing waiting for take-out orders.
Even without this hiccup, the service seemed very amateur--not snooty, as I've read in other reviews--just nowhere near as good as it should be given the price of the meal.
In my experience, Olympic Flame, a traditional NYC Greek coffee shop, offers good value for one's money in terms of food cost but passable to rude service, depending on who you get.
Again in a group 6 months ago, the service was even worse this time, practically begging for water and other drinks while we waited an age just to get our orders taken.
The atmosphere is bland and non-descript and the service is fine.
FOOD WAS OK,SERVICE NOT SO OK,WAITED FOR THE CHECK WHILE OUR WAITER WAS GOSSIPPING,WAITED FOR CHANGE,WHILE OUR WAITER WAS GOSSIPPING.
Waiting for a table is par for the course.
The service is good, but the staff is not too friendly.
The wait was not very long and the staff was great.
There is no service at this bar, which means no drinks or food -- ultimately leading to a very frustrating night out, and you end up kicking yourself for not leaving an hour earlier.
Although the food what adequate, the service was preposterous.
Although the decor is lovely as usual, service has detiorated.
If the staff actually got it together and showed some customer service this place would be good.
So, if you don't care about speedy service, go; but if you aren't in the habit of lighting your cigarette with twenties, avoid the tapas.
The food is consistantly great, but the wait is often long and the noise is often deafening.
We were seated fastly enough, and ordering was painless, but I got the wrong appetizer, we both received the same item instead.
probably not worth the wait on the weekend when pomodoro is a block away but worth getting for delivery if you are in the area or for dinner during the week.
The margaritas were mediocre, but it did not make up for the muzak they played in the resturant nor the bad food and drink they served.
The food as always was fantastic, and the pricing was moderate although I was not happy about the 18% gratuity being added for parties over 6, especially after the horrible service we recieved.
sushi portions were bigger than most places and service was average, far better options available in the area.
The service was lacking a bit, we waited about 20 mins for a waiter and water to come to us once we were sat and we had to ask for everything twice, even drink orders - I think maybe we just got stuck with a bad waiter though.
The only downside was the service was slow and our waitress kept forgetting to bring our drinks.
There is a litte bit of a wait on the food, but it is well worth it!
We showed up and waited 30 minutes in line 30 minutes to get our drinks -after we asked twice, the service was the worst I've had in nyc.
It is a small restaurant so without reservations, there can be a long wait.
But the service, though invariably genial and helpful, can be weirdly haphazard -- waiters disappear mysteriously, only to reemerge just when you've decided their shift must have ended -- possibly an understaffing issue?
The pro's: Good ambience,service The Con's: For the 4 to 5 star price (200 dollars for 2 people which included 2 drinks each, an appetizer, main course, and a hsared dessert), the food and presentation was just average.
Service was not snooty and you'll be treated the same whether you order one of the $150+ kaiseki dinners or a single entree.
Our waiter must have been a 'stand-in' because he did not know the menu, choices or basic service protocol (bread plate on the left).
We got there before our reservation and the seated us quickly.
However, the service has SIGNIFICANTLY declined since they expanded into the back room.
The only complaints (minor) was a 15 minute wait when we had a 10 PM reservation and the tables are pretty close to one another.
Food is decent but portions are so tiny and the whole meal is served on huge plate which makes it look even more ridiculous.
Aside from the service being slow, the place was packed w/ a good crowd and music was amazing.
After making reservations almost a month in advance, I was very disappointed to be seated in a secluded area for dinner next to the sushi bar and KITCHEN!!!!!!!
He did do the service part well enough -- brought the food, etc.
it is too bad because the food, ambiance, and drinks were great but they need serious help on the service.
We tried the Tasting menu', and the manager offered to select the items to be served after taking inputs from us ( Choice of meat, allergies etc.
I have worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years, and so am understanding of things out of my server's control, and I have never experienced such poor service!
The service was very rushed and as we were finishing our drinks and paying our bill, the owner asked us to leave so he could seat other people at our table.
If I went back, I'd have dinner in the bar--better service and even better atmosphere.
My vegetable Napoleon was good; although i first got the veggie burger because the waitress mis-heard and stood my friend up for another 15 minutes of waiting to have it served.
Service during either brunch or dinner could be quicker and more attentive at times.
I have no complaints about the wait or the service but the pizza was not at all something to write home about.
Service was prompt, although at times the waiters seemed to be spending more time dealing with the overflow from the bar than the diners (ever heard of cocktail waiters).
Its good to go there for drinks if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad.
That being said, they do have a nice lounge area downstairs where you can just hang out, have a seat, and relax (no more waiting out in the cold or at the crowded bar).
Service was slow (20 minutes wait time before they came back with our drinks, not including 10 minute wait for them to take our drink order).
Go there for dinner this time and find it unusually bad in taste and not pleasent service at all.
my table of four was not totaly neglected, but there was a lag in how promptly we were being served.
Worth the trip and the wait (and the higher than average price)?
The journey may be long and the wait may be longer, but there is nothing that could keep me from this pizza.
My friend ordered the scallops which were served in a light red sauce that was complemented very nicely with atichoke palms.
Service is not particularly warm, but I've gone back again and again (for dinner) over the years on an almost monthly basis.
The food and drinks held up to eatery's rep and the service was just as good if not better.
The food had a somewhat elevated price tag but but fair considering the Nobu origin - The cocktails highly recommended including the spide and lobster roll - we were well plated and did not encounter any arragance from the staff - maybe the other student reviewers are used to cafeteria service.
After being seated outside by the host, a waitress came over and yelled at us for taking a table that belonged to people waiting at the bar.
Summary good service, bad food!
People will literally spend their entire lunch break waiting and for what - an average fastfood burger.
The Food Brasserie favorites are prepared by the book: Onion soup gratinee bubbles with a thick layer of Gruyere cheese, and grilled shell steak is served medium-rare, with a side of crisp shoestring potatoes.
Unfortunately, as we were finishing up, the manager hovered around us and asked us to go to the bar to finish our drinks because there were other people waiting.
This seems to be a big hit and draws a large crowd, so be prepared for a wait.
95 all-you-can-eat lunch is tooted as a good deal but a the ambiance is dreadful and you can get a terrific meal, also kosher vegetarian, in peace with service just around the corner for $2 more.
The food is really great but the service is absolutely horrible!
My friend and I were the ONLY 2 people in the entire place seated for dinner and after sitting there for 15 minutes, I had to walk over to our surly waiter and ask for menus.
The place is a little over-priced for brunch but it is a nice restaurant so that was expected Food (i had the omelette with cheddar, mushrooms and herbs), service, coffee, atmosphere were all fantastic.
I went for an early dinner the other night and encountered the worst service i have experienced in a long time.
If coming to Tea and Anthipathy (yea u heard me) during conventional dining hours, expect a good long wait on the curb till tables open up.
Bringing a large group on a busy Saturday night ,I was afraid quality of food and service might not be up to par, but we were seated promptly and the service by our waitress was fantastic considering how busy it was.
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional.
I recently attended a celebratory dinner here and I just want to warn everyone that the service is the worst I have ever experienced!
The presentation was clever, and the food tasty however the service that accompanied it was so slow it made us feel neglected.
While the people here were nice and the service was very good, the food was not very good - it was extremely greasy, the place did not offer alternatives such as egg whites and PAM spray instead of oil, coffee was average Crystal Rock Office Flavored Coffee - not the good coffee.
Service was a little but flawed, (they brought us beers without the glasses brought the main course out before cleaning off the appetizers) but nothing that would ruin your evening.
I went there for lunch with co-workers and found the service to be prompt and very friendly.
When we received the bill, we asked the manager to do something about the drinks, considering how poor the service was and her reply was, Well, you got them!
I had a party of 9 reservation and was very disappointed at the service.
Expect a crowd while waiting, but they seat quickly.
I must admit the times my family (6 or more) have had dinner there the service seemed to forget us after serving the main course.
We were seated promptly, and after an inordinate wait, somebody took our drink order and disappeared for half an hour.
Though it might be a wait and the service might leave a little to be desired, anyone that has ever eaten there agrees that the food is worth it.
Service was atrocious: appetizers came out 3 minutes after we ordered, and 10 minutes before we finally tracked down the bottle of wine we had ordered, the waiter rushed us from start to finish, we had to repeatedly track down someone to pour us more wine since it wasn't at the table, etc, etc.
My appetizer of endive and bleu cheese salad was a surprisingly large serving which balanced the striped bass entree (served on a bed of vegetables).
Though the service leaves a lot to be desired, and the waitstaff runs around like chickens without heads, the beer is cold, the sake is hot, and the sushi is out of this world!
People waiting for tables stand at a drink rail next to large windows which open out over a leafy garden in the summertime.
beside i have to wait long time with my food, waiter service ok but unfriendly.
Our waiter said 3 words to us, wisked away our food as we were finishing, and the maitre'd could not take his eyes off our table waiting for us to leave.
the service was slow took ten mins to get me a glass of water.
They were rude, didn't know their drinks and were unable to demonstrate any professionalism in their service mentality.
But the service was absolutely terrible, and we watied 45 minutes for food.
The food was good but we were dissatisfied with waiting too long for a uncomfortable table.
Service was horrendous the night we went for dinner.
The sangria was served quickly and often.
We were seated promptly for a Saturday lunch, but service was incredibly slow.
My only complaint is waiting a bit between the appetizer and the main course but it was well worth it.
The service could be better but the management (Mariano) is quite helpful if there are any problems.
Also, try to get a seat at the main bar, because I sat at the smaller bar by the entrance and it was getting so crowded with people waiting that it became a bit unpleasant towards to end of the meal.
Definitely make reservations if you can -- they'll honor them, and you can skip the massive wait!
Their service can use a little assistance, but their food is great.
The overpriced ice cream is delicious but the service is atrocious - not only do I have to wait to be admitted into this ice cream joint, but the waiter is a snide, gruff man more suited to be a trucker than an ice cream shop server.
You have to wait in line most of the time, but the burgers are worth it and the beer is cheap.
We had a reservation for Monday lunch and were seated promptly, which was a pleasant surprise.
The menu can give you price shock but the food, service and drinks are worth every stinking penny.
However, the service was so excellent, we added $10 to the tip!
I think I'm going to start taking the food and coffee to go b/c everytime I go there (which is quite often) I get more frustrated with the service.
There was a ten minute wait with a reservation, but the bar kept us entertained.
Meals not served at once and service was inattentive and forgetful.
Seated in the upstairs part of the restaurant my party and I were subjected to rude, abrupt service and unmercifully long waits for our food.
The good service started from the moment we walked in the front door.
We waited in standing at the entrance for 5 mins to get seats due to just slow service, another 10mins to get menu, and then another 10mins to get water bread.
When spending upwards of $200 for dinner for two, I expect better service.
The food is average, however the service is way below average (our waiter was a stuttering fool when it came to the specials and left our drinks empty for the majority of the night) The atmostphere is cheesy as well as the crowd.
Service at the bar was fine, just as you would expect.
The bartender has a nasty attitude, and it took a party of two 1 1/2 hours to get seated while party after party of the hosts 'friends' were given seating immediately.
I am hoping the stale service was a one shot deal because it was deplorable for what we paid for dinner!
The waitress, host, and bus staff were sitting around at the bar while the patrons were all complaining about the service.
The service is excellent and always informative without an air.
The service was horrendous, not only did the waiter take an hour to remember we ordered drinks, we were rushed to eat and get out so they could seat the next party.
The french fries are soggy, the service is so/so and while it looks like a cute little homestyle cafe you'd find in SF, the food is below average.
The manager then comes over to the table and asks us to leave - to help him out because there were people waiting!
The staff treated them like true royalty.
B/c the dinner focused on good friends and good food, not waiting around for service or being bothered by rude staff to leave.
I planned a holiday dinner at Kurio and we ended up waiting two hours for the appetizers.
This was not the same hostess I usually see there who happens to be very sweet and provides excellent service.
Serving things like Chicken Kiev with a garlic mashed potato egg roll for $$ with the snooty attitude to match!
Park your trench coat at the coat check and be prepared for fine dining, expert / attentive table service and a delectable cuisine.
the service is so-so; our waiter told us there was a table for us, then took us back to the entrance , we then waited another fifteen minutes- confusion seems to reign.
Food presented well and the service once we were seated was great but we had a long wait for our table (about half an hour) even though I had pre-booked.
I also do not think waiters there are rude- yes there are not friendly and chatty, but do provide great service.
Their delivery of fresh hot pizza.
I have never been treated more rudely than I was by the hostess and the manager of Public for brunch last Sunday; the hostess was arrogant, despicable, and mean to our party (reminder: she is a hostess in the service industry).
Hostess continued to ask us if everything was okay, and then did nothing when we gave her specific actions (how about some water or coffee served in paper cups).
The service always ruins your food if it's poor.
Long wait for our meal (approx 30 minutes), unusual slow service, waitresses (especially the preety one with black hair) louder thn clients, do not care much for customers.
I have gotten warmer and much friendlier welcome and outstanding service at the other Thai restaurants in the Greenpoint area.
Obviously we did not get right service and nobody said soory for that and other restaurant guests who came after us got quicker dish than us.
What I don't get is asking a high rolling, forgiving of bad service, drink guzzling table like mine to leave as soon as we finished out last sip of $12 martinis and left a 25% tip.
the food at pongal is average, the rava masala dosa is much better at madras mahal (a few doors down) and certainly the service at pongal is the worst among the indian restaurants along that block.
The ambiance and service is great but I wish I could say the same about the food.
Then we were led downstairs to the main room, and were seated at the huge communal dining room table.
I have eaten here for nearly three years, with firends with family, the service is great attentive and informed, perfect for Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.
The first time, the food was decent for lunch, but remember mediocre service.
90 for a porterhouse steak for 2 (ordered medium-rare, delivered well-done, dry and tasteless) and I'm not even full.
the service was inattentive (didn't bring us wine til our main course was already served and didn't open the bottle in front of us!!!
decent, if greasy, fishsticks, but served on a mound of soggy fries that could feed about 5-6 people!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, MAKE RESERVATIONS FAR IN ADVANCE TO AVOID LONG WAIT TIMES.
The service is great - they are very attentive and fast, however, they do make faces and comments when you order alot of the ALL YOU CAN EAT food.
the manager was nice profecional and service was average but the food was not italian, a diner is better, try po'
The service was attentive but overdone for the tiny and very ordinary setting and poor food.
Sure the service isn't the best but the food is tasty and the prices are great.
Maybe I've just gotten lucky with seating, but I've never had more than a ten minute wait.
We were put on the wait list, seated in 15 min after a quick drink at the bar and had an incredibly entertaining waiter and dined next to a few regulars who raved.
I'd recommend getting an appetizer b/c the dinner takes a bit to be cooked, but it was definitely worth the wait.
He met me for wine tasting/sampling of food the week before and made sure that the service was on their toes.
We had an hour for lunch, and service was impeccable each time.
We had reservations and were seated immediately, got a nice table by the window.
We placed a delivery order - 2 pastas and a caprese and they took and 1 1/2 to get here and the food was inedible when we received it.
service is quick, not overly friendly, but hey it's a small place and the servers are constantly busy.
It is never a ridiculous wait no more than 30 minutes, in the meantime you can chat with your friends and start the week-end off right with a signature drink from the bar!
My date and I were excited to go, and didn't even mind the 25 minute wait (EVEN WITH OUR RESERVATION) to get a table.
After waiting to get a table for over a half hour even though we had reservations, we went up to the host.
My wife and I had an 8:30 reservation, we show up a few minutes before and the host mumbles something to us about waiting at the bar and they'll tell us when the table is ready.
) My date and I were greeted by the host and informed there would be a slight wait.
Overall, cute place with poor service, and even worse food.
As for price, there are plenty of Shanghai restaurants in Chinatown that are just as inexpensive with better food and without a doubt much better customer service.
The wait (despite reservation) was 35 minutes (in an over-crowded bar) no apologies whatsoever.
By this I mean that the guy selling hotdogs outside of Grand Central has given me better service.
I went to Mocca with my boyfriend for a few drinks and food, and I was really impressed by the service.
Unfortunately, service was slow and when our server noticed we had not received our entree he comp'ed us two delightful margaritas - AND charged us only for appetizers , thereby cutting our bill in half.
The food is so good that there tends to be a little bit of a wait.
Though if the restaurant got bigger, the service and quality of the food would probably suffer.
I had a reservation for a Staurday night and after a 1 hour and 45 minute wait, we still were not seated!!
The food is average and the service is insulting.
be prepared for a long wait at dinner.
This restaurant has taken the trend of serving tiny portions on oversized plates to a new level.
IT'S GREAT COFFEE BUT THE SERVICE IS SERVED WITH BIG TIME ATTITUDE.
The service is more than attentive, and they also have a $10 corking fee so you can bring your own wine.
The service was good, if a little slow, and the place was very crowded (which can be comforting, but on a date it may be hard with the constant noise).
The margaritas took me on an instant vacation, and although there was a bit of a wait for a table, the food was well worth it.
The food did come out quickly and was good, but not worth the prices or the wait.
NOTE: Plan ahead, make a reservation and arrive early - parking is tight in the area - valet service is available if all else fails!
If you want great Italian food, fairly price, good service, in Brooklyn, a couple of subway stops from Union Square,(where you should complain about the prices) go to Al Di La.
My husband and I sat at the bar, and service was excellent.
I've ben waiting to try Al Di La for a while, but the menu just never grabbed me.
the 3rd however, the waiter forgot to put in our order for food and we ended up waiting an hour for them (b/c they were really busy).
Fun atmosphere, good beer selection, but meals were skimpy portions on big plates and the service was weak - never had the same server/waitperson come back twice.
No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.
Food is average, service is awful, and the attitude isn't New York - it's just plain rude - and most of NYC is caring and courteous.
There was a short wait for a table, which we spent at the bar, then we were seated on their patio.
At 1:15 we were still waiting for our plates!
Nevertheless, after waiting for an eternity to be seated, we finally sit down and wait for our menus, wait for our food, and to our surprise the food was minimal relative to the price.
After waiting 40 minutes for a table and 30+ for our entrees, our waiter was distracted.
The service was adequate though we did need to keep asking for water and the drinks from the bar took a long time- plus the restaraurant was not crowded.
: after ordering a bottle of wine (which was originally, inexplicably mistaken for 2 glasses of it), the (2) waitresses in charge of the outdoor space claimed that the bottle was right there in the only cooler used to service about 10 tables.
The service was very good, although the food was mediocre.
The wait can be long especially during brunch time but worth it.
I called ahead and was told that there would be no problem seating a party of two at 5:30, arrived at 5:30, was told there would be a 5 to 10 minute wait.
I'll give it to Sea; the decor is pretty cool and the food was good, but the service was beyond terrible!
While the service and setting were average, the food was excellent.
Within 10 minutes of being seated at our table, the hostess asked us if we could move.
But despite that our dinner took far too long to be served.
I was shocked to have gotten no apology from the management, and to top it off were charged for the drinks we had while patiently waiting for food that never arrived.
I've been there for lunch many times and the service is always cheerful and efficient.
The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is.
This is of course after waiting forever for menus and eventually having to ask for them.
our dinner was marred by painfully slow service.
After arriving for a pre-theatre reservation to find the kitchen closed due to a mechanical failure, the problem was fixed an hour later (after many drinks at the bar, none of which management offered as a concession to the wait) and we were served a very good dinner in time to make the play.
If you mind waiting for your pie to be made (the wait canbe over an hour, especially for a square pie), I recommend calling ahead and placing your order for pick-up.
Service was ok, took a while to order even drinks.
Nonetheless, we are looking forward to the next time for more pizza and the great service.
Space is teeny tiny so waiting at the bar meant getting poked and bumped repeatedly, but hostesses were nice and wine selection was ample.
The Sushi was of the highest caliber, the cut as if a master samurai marks smith was behind the bar, and service, just what you would expect from a fine dining establishment, New York style.
but the wait for seating can be exasperating.
To sum it up: Service varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok.
you might have made a reservation, but you will end up waiting for about an hour anyway, so hopefully you'll get a seat at the bar and won't have to stand around.
While being shown to our table by a hostess, we were welcomed by Lidia Bastianich herself and seated at a great table in the dining room -- not too secluded, but not noisy.
Maybe it was because we went during the restaurant week lunch special, but the service was not impressive at all and the food was okay, but not great.
Been here a few times and food has always been good but service really suffers when it gets crowded.
Go in, take a deep breath and expect great food, fairly priced with just about the worst service in North Jersey!
The service on our visit was absolutely awful - a waiter and two helpers couldn't get our orders right and ignored several pleas for basics such as water and beverage refills and utensils to eat desserts with.
I recently ate Brunch there and was dismayed and dissapointed by the service.
We asked for our check (to pay for our drinks and leave), and received the quickest service all evening.
the busboys were fantastic -- very attentive when it came to replenishing chips, removing dishes, but I have to say the waitress service was not quite as good.
Wonderful service, not too long a wait for tables, price is right - in a word, go!
Although the food was great, the service was so bad that I can't see myself ever returning.
At the end of the meal the waitress asked if we wanted another drink, the after agreeing to have one she stated, actually there's a list of people waiting, can you go next door to the bar.
I have never had a bad meal or service (on a couple of occasions I waited past my reservation time).
The food was good, but it's not worth the wait--or the lousy service.
they continue to expand their garden space, w/out expanding their kitchen and cannot provide even adequate service.
1) Service is very slow and unattentive (10 minutes for our server to come by with our menus and to take our drink order, another 10 to bring the drinks/take our dinner order, you get the idea.
Went with my father without a reservation, and the maitre d' was very nice and sat us within 15 minutes of our arrival - we had been told that the wait would be an hour (this may be unusual).
The atmosphere was wonderful, however the service and food were not.
Don't know about the rest of the food, but the burgers are one of New York's hidden treats.
The drinks were really good- albeit a bit weird served out of baby bottles.
Service was good throughout the dinner but when it came time to get the check, we waited over 20 min.
One friend had the steak which he didn't care for, but after waiting so long to be seated he was hungry.
I thought it was great, best service I've ever had in a long time.
Although Nobu requires a 2-3 month advanced reservations, it's worth the wait!
the service was horrible then and the food was decent.
The bar area was fairly crowded but service remained friendly and efficient.
Yes it's pricey for counter service, sawdust floors and deafening chatter but the pastrami makes it all worth it.
For the prices, the food is decidedly lackluster, and the service, unless you are a regular, can be quite rude.
The only saving grace is the sweet tea - but even that isn't worth the wait.
Oh, and kudos to the hostess who appeared out of thin air with extra napkins just moments after a glass of water was knocked over - she's upping the bar on service here.
service was attentive at the beginning but the waiter lost us towards the end and we had to flag them down for the check.
when I came back for brunch a week or so later, I was told that the marscapone version was no longer being served, because there was a new cook.
Our food took so long to be served that we nearly missed our curtain.
Went to Gallaghers for the first time on a Saturday night, had no problem getting reservations, great staff-great service.
Service was fine and the food delivered in reasonable time given the crowd, but for the price I was disappointed.
The service is smart and though they can be overwhelmed with the crowds, does a good job.
Even if you're just a middling junior exec, staff service makes you feel like a board member.
The waitor never gave us the specials menu (which they gave to a another couple who sat next to us 20 minutes later) and the service was very slow even for the basics (bread and water, for which we had to ask a couple of times).
Tried to get a table during restaurant week but there was an over an hour wait.
Although the restaurant was far from crowded (maybe three tables), service was abysmally slow, to the point that we wondered if the server was trying to avoid us.
But the wait staff's attitude will make me rethink about returning.
45 minutes later our less-than-stellar pizza and their even less-than-stellar gnoccho was dropped at the table; no explanation or apology or attempt to acknowledge the ridiculous wait.
The service was spotty as a couple of drink orders were forgotten and the waiter didn't really come to check on us.
calle ocho is definitely high on my list, the food and mojitos are excellent (the sangria is a miss, flor de sol has much better sangria) but the service leaves much to be desired.
The Food Skip the menu and head for the restaurant's bountiful and ever-changing vegan buffet for an abundance of affordable servings.
I live about a 1/2 block from Westway and when I want consistantly good food, big portions, great fast service and a step above your average diner food I go there!
Got the check tossed on table 10 minutes after being served and hostess came by to rush us some more.
It took us about 30 minutes to get seated, the burgers came without lettuce, they brougt us the wrong drinks, and the flavor of the burgers were below average.
Even when the chef is not in the house, the food and service are right on target.
great decor, unfortunately the worst service possible.
The service was terrible- our waiter was unable to make any recommendations, mumbled the special and failed to check back during the course of our meal.
The raspberry/marscapone-stuffed pancakes are so divine it's actually worth putting up with the rude and incompetent service.
You wanna wait a hour for a cramped table to eat mom's macaroni and cheese?
Got a table during restaurant week for lunch and the service was cordial, if slower than usual.
The service was professional if somewhat slow, though we didn't mind since it is such a welcoming place to have dinner.
The food is fantastic, Gourmet comfort food and has gotten progressively better over the past year, as did the service.
My friend also knew the chef, so we had some other courses not on the menu, but even knowing the chef didn't get us the service I would expect at this type of restaurant.
Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.
After an hour of waiting at an overcrowded bar with our coats in our hands and no room to move, I approached the host (who never bothered to give us an update throughout our wait) to ask him how much longer, He was incredibly rude and dismissed me with his hand and walked away from me while I was trying to talk to him!
The raw bar that we were served was abyssmal, and our dinners of salmon (mine overcooked) and chicken (hers, very bland) weren't much better.
The service, which was horrendous - they charged us for two appetizers when we asked to split one (when we brought it up, he insisted that the appetizer really did only consist of 2 sliced tomatoes and 1 slice of cheese).
the place is small but everything else is 'big' in terms of quality variety and smiles of the wait service.
I have dined at JG many times for dinner and lunch over the past two years and both the food and the service is by far the best compared to others in NYC or else where.
This is a busy spot from 1130 AM to 130 PM M-F but you never have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table, unless you have a large party, thanks to fast and friendly service provided by the waitstaff and kitchen.
We probably would have stuck out the wait if we could have gotten a drink at the bar but apparently it was closed or only for show.
My complaint was the service was not that good but the food made up for it.
For a 4-star restaurant (not to mention a $400 dinner for two), attentive service is expected.
Don't look for sushi on the menu although there's tons of sake and it's served properly.
The food is average, at best (I have been repeatedly underwhelmed by the mediocre fare) and the service is only good if Elaine is within range.
The restaurant is loud, the tables are wooden and the service is OK.
Since the service was so poor, we asked if they could offer any concessions - complimentary drinks?
The appetizers are ok, but the service is slow.
We could not believe that the owner only laughed and continued serving him drinks.
My friend and I walked in to an over crowded bar and were warned of a 45 minute wait.
The food is pretty good, but after 2 or 3 bad experiences at the restaurant (consistently rude, late with RSVP'd seating), I decided I would only order delivery.
We were told by the hostess to make sure we were on time for our reservation, which we were, but then they kept us waiting for 15 minutes when we got there.
The pretty waitstaff is always pleasant, but service is inconsistent at best.
MeetLESS gives you a dance club w/o the dance floor a restaurant w/ horrendous service and limited menu selections (the ONLY steak is a top sirloin?!!!)
Be warned though, this plaice gets packed at lunch - and the service can be rottenly slow-going.
After being seated by a very kind, but quite stressed, young lady, we took in the room and menu.
The service was punctual, having been asked for our drink orders even before opening our menus.
Regardless of the amount of customers, the wait for food is insanely long.
Service was a tad spotty, but the food was VERY good and the noise never detracted from the dining experience.
The service was impeccible, the menu traditional but inventive and presentation for the mostpart excellent but the food itself came up short.
We went for lunch on Saturday, wait wasn't bad considering that it had only opened recently.
The food is undeniably good -- but not worth the wait.
Anyway, I went down on a Wednesday night to see if they had a long wait and the hostess said they had a table to accomodate my party.
If you would like to charge us 5 dollars for service that would be fine, though comming from a restaurant where we buy a dessert for a bithday I thinks it's a bit cheap.
Our waiter was well versed with the menu and provided us with great service, he didn't hover over the table as some servers tend to do in high end restaurants.
also, when i was waiting to be seated the bartender gave great service and mixed a mean cocktail for me.
Just make sure everyone is in your party is there together or you'll be waiting on the sidewalk or in the cramped bar next door.
Hostess was extremely accommodating when we arrived an hour early for our reservation.
We were a couple of minutes late for our reservation and minus one guest, but we didn't think we deserved the attitude we got from the hostess.
Though the service might be a little slow, the waitresses are very friendly.
Although we arrived at the restaurant 10 min late, the hostess did not have a table for us.
It was very loud, I felt too crowded, the man chair's next to me made it impossible for the waiters to pass.
Portions are fairly generous and the staff brings out multiple little bites and treats throughout dinner.
After reading other reviews I was expecting poor service and ambience but was pleasantly surprised by our more than helpful waiter.
I was told by the hostess that a specific table would be mine once the customers left and I waited 45 minutes for that to happen.
Towards the end of our meal, a server came out, apparently our orders had been double-filled.
The beginning of the meal wasnt bad, the hostess was very nice, we got our drinks about every 10 minutes and the appetizers we good.
I found that the food variety was great, and the waitress was very accommodating to my vegan boyfriend describing all items' ingredients and how you may request more of what YOU like, creating a unique experience.
Our waitress couldn't tell us what was in the seafood special, forgot to put in our oyster order so it came at the same time as the main meals, wasn't able to provide a confident recommendation from the menu, and had to be flagged several times for drinks.
Server's were extremely nice, yet were socializing too much with friends that were having drinks at the bar and it was difficult to get their attention.
And there wasn't much room for the people at the bar to stand either, as the restaurant attempted to squeeze as many tables into the restaurant as they could, forcing those dining to have to shift in their chairs every time a waiter attempted to get by.
Before our food arrived I asked our waitress if we could be moved and she just stared blankly at me.
The service is excellent -- the staff is attentive and the waitress was well-informed about the menu.
It is the only all Austrian wine list in the country and the waitress gladly broke it down for me, so I could find just the right wine for my meal.
The final blow was when the waiter brought us the check before we had even finished dessert--never mind that the only reason we were taking a long time to finish the meal was because of the extreme delay in the service of our food.
They served the main course before the appetizers eventhough we asked for the latter first, to which our waiter responded that they don't serve them separately without telling us beforehand while ordering.
After requesting to be seated at an empty table, the waitress (who was so terribly burdened when we asked to move from the bar to the table to have dinner) asked us to get up from our seats and wait for a smaller table because a party of 3 just walked in.
Be warned that this place can get pretty crowded, though the $3 bloody mary's at the bar and the killer DJ make the wait more than bearable.
As if that wasnt enough, after another in the group mentioned that a portion of the sushi on her plate was not what she had ordered, the waiter came back with chopsticks and started to remove it (as she was eating!)
The waiter was just throwing our dishes on the table without even clearing the appetizer plates and then they started clearing the food when we weren't even finished yet.
Before we can even order desert, the waitress comes and tells us we have to leave because the host wanted our table.
Our server did not check on us, ask if we needed anything, refill our water or get our dessert order right.
The ONLY negative was when we asked the waiter to secretly bring birthday cake and some other desserts for the table.
Sometimes, the take-out and seating lines can be long, but the staff help move things along.
A+  was planning a party for my staff, and was treated rudely by another restaurant when trying to add more people to reservation (a simple no would have worked).
They expanded the seating with a cozy new back section, added some great new dishes (I had the most fantastic j erk Shrimp and exciting maize crusted salmon) but kept everything that was good (amazing staff and Mac Jack!)
Not to mention that the busboy spilled 2 glasses of water on my back and the Manager was NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
Smiling servers quiz diners with movie trivia, but forget to fill their water glasses.
The waiter was miffed when we decided to order dessert (and I must say we were eating the courses as they arrived, no lingering).
Chef Anthony is warm and is always fixing up something unique and tasty in the kitchen to send to your table.
The kitchen is open and surrounded by bar seating (the only kind of seating), and they have a nice set-up where the waitress stays behind the bar and the chefs deliver your food after you have watched them prepare it.
Although our waitress was pleasant and accomdating, the overpriced food was quite the opposite.
Bartenders look like model wannabes and threw out my friend's beer before he was finished (about 1/4 left).
Perhaps if the owner manager would concentrate more on service then acting as a dj this restaurant would run better.
The atmosphere was really nice and inviting but our waiter was awful!
I always listen to the waiters' recommendations, because they're always awesome - either a special or just one of their faves off the menu.
The decor is sparse and elegant, the service warm (though my waitress was occasionally difficult to find), and the sushi fresh.
I waited 15 minutes for the waiter to take the bill from me and finally I got fed up with him walking past our table I had to start waving the bill in the air and finally some other waitress took our bill.
It was practically impossible to get the waitstaff's attention to order another bottle of wine.
After spending over $500 on a business dinner, a manager knelt down at our table and asked us to quote, wrap it up and move to the bar.
Friendly staff happily accepted a reservation (for 10), and when only 6 showed up, they couldn't have been more understanding!
At our table we didn't get any bread until 30 minutes into the seating, which may I emphasize the waiter took really long to come to our table, about 20 minutes.
Then, the waitress gave my wife coffee with regular milk in it even though my wife specifically requested Soy Milk.
Waiter was a strange bird and when told we wanted to enjoy our dining experience and not be rushed through dinner, he assured us it takes 30 minutes to get entrees once food was ordered.
Eventually another waiter cleaned up the table and allowed us to sit there.
However the hostess completely ignored us, we waited 40 min at the bar (even with reservation), our waitress was incredibly uninterested in us (never even offered dessert menus) and the somelier could have taken a look at the label before he made a mistake about his favorite wine.
I went there with family and even though we had reservations, we were seated 30 minutes late, the food took 45 minutes to arrive and when I got the wrong order, I had a hard time trying to find the server.
The wait was much shorter than the hostess quoted, which was great.
When we got our food, the waitress barely said a word as she placed our take-out on the table and grabbed the check.
However, it takes ages to get seated (even with a reservation), and the waiters don't seem very knowledgeable about the menu (or receptive to questions).
Ok the manager did stand at the bar the whole time looking like his wife left him, he lost all his money at the track and had been drinking the rest of the day.
We complained to our waiter serveral times about this and the stares continued and to top it all off as the manager walked around to each table asking if they enjoyed their dinner, he conveniently did not ask us!
He is a gracious chef who comes to the table and greets the guests.
The waiter said they mixed it up because there were three similar things on the menu.
) Scores of employees walking around, but no one seems to clear a plate or offer more drinks.
The manager also managed to insult one of my dining partners, even using an expletive to mock his last name when returning his credit card.
The waiter told us that he had checked with the kitchen because he noticed that we had not gotten our dinners and they said it would be out shortly, shouldn't someone have said something to us?
But servers, attentive if slightly unpolished, gladly direct inquisitors to menu strengths--like rum-flambeed dessert bananas foster--and allow leisurely enjoyment.
SO I ASKED, TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER, AND ONE OF THE OWNER WHO MANAGES THE PLACE CAME TO MY TABLE, TOLD ME THAT THE CEVICHE WAS FRESH.
Spoke with the manager about comping a round, after we had already paid for 2 rounds waiting for the table.
For example, we had ordered a 2nd bottle of red wine, the waitress gave me a new glass to taste the wine, but filled up my existing glass (mixing two different bottles in one glass).
Weekday lunch is less crowded and the staff cheerfully tolerated a 3-year-old.
The staff beginning with the tall gentleman at the door, waiters, etc.
The food and service was top notch, only the complain is that this place is so small that some seats are not made for a big guy.
The hostess was condescending and the waiter was somewhat absent and unaccomodating (sure, we made a reservation to sit outside but when I asked to be moved indoors after I heard thunder he didn't even try to make it happen, giving me a blank stare and a shrug when I asked what we would do if it rained).
I was told(very snottily) no, but then not even 10 minutes later another group of people came in, asked the same thing and because the same woman waiter knew them she gave them regular menus!
It's so out there that it works--black-clad raver waiters and all--and even the most normal of groups love getting together for dinner and popular brunching on the palm-lined backyard patio spread.
The waitress came to our table and told us about their tempting specials.
We asked the server for two glasses with a splash of Southern Comfort and Grand Marnier.
Went to celebrate my sisters birthday on 9/11 was 1st taken back on the waiters rude answering of a question we had about the menu.
There is no bar so therefore no place to wait except the lounge that was packed so after wondering where to stand the hostess grabbed us.
Before leaving the server gave us takeout menus.
The waiter just slapped my food down and then never returned until he slapped my check down.
The bartenders could have been a lot nicer but the drinks they shook up kind of made up for their poor attitude.
The waiter returned seconds later to complain that dozens of people wanted our table then poured her beer into a paper cup-- presumably to encourage us to leave faster.
The waitstaff is helpful and they'll get your favorite meats to circle your table more often if you just ask.
One server came and gave us food that turned out to be someone else's.
The wine did not come until we were half way through our entree and the waitress overcharged us by a bottle of wine.
Enjoy the food, because it is remarkable, but don't be too willing to be gratuitis to a server that does not deserve it.
The waiter placed the wrong entree in front of us each time.
The wait was long which is understandable but the waiters were rude to us while we waited, rushed us to order, ignored us while we ate and needed more drinks, and rushed us when they wanted the table for another couple.
the waiter was unable to identify whether certain cheeses from the cheese course were cow or goat milk.
While waiting there was no room for standing and the bar staff and their drinks were horrendous.
The word chicken was barely out of my mouth when the waiter rushed away from my table without asking me about side orders or a drink.
The waitress was no where to be found at all throughout the course of the meal, did not refill a single drink nor did she bother to inquire about my satisfaction with the food or even bring the check at the conclusion of the meal.
The four of us were seated in the outdoors patio(not requested) and suffered through a muddled menu, indifferent food, a below average waiter, as well as excessive noise, wind and cold.
The waiter was rude to my friend when she asked for a small plate to share an appetizer.
Our waiter, though he was charming,was too busy to truly take care of us properly and the food was over priced.
The staff forgot my girlfriend's food altogether as she waited for half an hour.
One oversight: the gf wanted tea to go along with the plate of yummies they gave me, but the server forgot to bring it since we took our time to finish the wine.
straining to read the menu under the low-lighting-tag-sale-chandelier motif, we were able to order a salad, tapas, and entrees from the first of several waiters, none of whom were able to introduce themselves, recommend dishes, present silverware, remove plates, or deliver water when asked.
The service is ok since it is new and the staff didn't know the food items too well.
Another hostess came by and told us that since we were now 5 we were a different table and couldnt' stay.
We were even able to call in advance to make sure there was space at the bar because I was on crutches and the owner reserved the seats til we got there.
We had hot buffalo tenders for an appetizer, and the waitress didn't bother to come back to check on how we were doing on drinks.
The actors try to draw your attention away from the better stuff that is happening below.
our waiter forgot a dish and we were constantly checked on afterwards and treated to a complimentary dessert for the mix up.
The staff had apparently booked the room for 2 groups with a 30 minute overlap.
The owners are incredibly nice too, comping pitchers of margaritas if you sit there and eat for a couple of hours.
After my friend and I were seated, we were greeted by a gorgeous waitress, who helped us make our way through the large selection of choices on the menu.
Our waiter was completely unfamiliar with the menu and did not bother to tell us that they were out of several items (even though we arrived at 7 pm on a Saturday night!)
And when I received my $9 glass of wine, I had to ask the waitress if she planned on putting more in -- there was hardly any liquid in the glass!
We were seated next to some obnoxious women who bogarted the server's time and attention, so he bought us drinks.
While admitably, the seating is a bit cramped, and the menu a tad pricey, the staff does its best to remedy concerns.
employees not fighting with each other in front of clients 3 having ALL the ingredients for the meals they have on there menue.
Beautifull people, and a dj that was making me just want to stay and drink more!
We got seated right away, We got a nice starter from the kitchen, unfortunately the waiter that brought it could not explain what it was, it was delicious though.
Her attitude put a damper on the evening, as did the stares from some servers when we took a peek into the cheese cellar.
After a short 30 minutes of chatting and enjoying our drinks we were approached by the very pretentious Maitre D' who RUDELY demanded we order as our table was needed.
We had to ask the busboy if bread came with our meal, which it did and we received after waiting about 30 minutes.
Yet the maitre d still sat us next to the bar.
We arrived, were greeeted and sked by the hostess I think if we were there for the Brunch, that was starting up again on today(3/12) the cost $25 per person.
And once the bill was paid, the bartender kept on giving us drinks.
The bartender had offered us ONE beer on the house for our troubles.
We had to request water and chips (tostades) and salsa three times (the third time my date had to go and track down the waitress) before finally being served (by the busser) and the place wasn't even a quarter full.
When we ordered our Margaritas, the waiter said $10, so we gave him a 20 and waited, and when he didn't give us our change, we asked and he said - Happy Hour's over, they're $10 each.
We objected at the ill flavor of the drinks and the manager was not understanding at all.
In addition, I've always found the waiters helpful with the wine selection, and there is always a good selection of wines by the glass.
Invited by friends to discuss business, I checked out the bar first, and didn't give my nme which was known to the owners Scott Heather.
The menu might have well been written in a foreign language and the wait staff didnt have a translation dictionary!
At one point, we tried to get our waitresses attention and she ignored us and than we asked for more biscuits and never got them.
One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.
Staff would not change a meal to accomadidate food allegeries.

I can't imagine waiting for 20 minutes to have my plates removed, given that usually the waitstaff hover around like birds of prey waiting for a fork to drop etc.
Oh, but on a brighter note, when the waiter poured water into my vodka glass by mistake, we got a free drink out of it.
My girlfriend asked the bartender what kind of wine they had and since she couldn't hear she leaned on the bar to get closer to him and he made a face and told her not to get near him.
Philippe should re-train their wait staff to communicate with one another and better orchestrate the timing of food service.
The waiter never came back to check on us or refill coffee, he got one of the orders wrong, and we both left wondering what we were going to eat when we got home.
But the waiter was very accomodating; he brought extra garlic bread at no charge, was attentive, and apologized profusely for not allowing us to order from the 12-and-under kids' menu.
The night I was there, besides extraordinary food and service, the owners; Carmelo Leotta and Pietro Cinquemani were belting out Mario Lanzi tunes on the Steinway piano.
The waiter's knowledge of the menu and ability to make recommendations were ridiculously bad, requests weren't observed effectively, and our water and wine glasses were not kept full.
First, the hostess gave us a nasty look when asked if we could eat at the bar, and then just swished her hand to indicate we could seat ourselves.
we ordered filets, and ny steaks eventhough our waiter kept pushing up to get the porterhouse.
There are a few things I can forgive at any popular place: somewhat long waits even with reservations, service staff that mistakenly believes they're there to act haughty rather than serve, and a way over-the-top interior.
Inside as we waited momentarily for our table, the bartender made light conversation as he made our drinks.
The waiter messed up my order and we had to hunt down the wait staff to get a second drink.
We were not offered bread and the host did not apologize until we asked for another update 45 minutes later.
A friend asked for cheese on her pasta and the waitstaff, including the manager, REFUSED to give it to her.
We asked the waitress very nicely to please change the playlist to something more appropriate for dinner, she chuckled to herself and said sure but never changed it.
We get our beers and then are told from a confuzed waitress that she realized that she can't give us the happy hour drink prices if we are not sitting at the bar.
There is no menu and the waiter never told us how much lunch was, I thought it couldn't be more than $35.
Every course was delicious, including the multiple chef samples, brought to you from the chef throughout your entire meal.
this has become one of my favorite spots to hang out at the bar and drink martinis, not only because the atmosphere is energetic and lively, but also becasue the staff are so friendly.
What we were treated to, instead, was snooty attitude by the waiter and the maitre d' and a dinner I couldn't eat.
We had to ask for water multiple times, there were no paper towels in the bathroom and even after informing a staff person they still were none an hour later.
If you're looking for nonstop attention, a 20 page wine list and a waiter who puts your napkin on your lap, this is not the place to go.
We hunted the waitress to at least pay for the drinks.
Our waiter (a real cutie) had to ask us twice for our entree selections, the coffee orders were wrong and after saying, no, thanks, the pepper man poised his mill above my friend's calamari dish and ground away.
Chef Richard is always eager to please, and will be happy make something special 'off the menu' if you ask.
We did not have reservations so we sat at the small bar with the friendly bartender for 10 minutes.
After we waited nearly 25 minutes for our food (the place wasnt crowded), our waiter forgot some of our order and brought out a salad when we asked for everything to come out all at once.
We often come with a baby and the staff is so sweet and kind to her, it is a joy to be there.
There were 6 servers standing around watching me eat but they never asked if I needed anything or even offered me water.
The waitress didn't seem to know anything about the menu, she forgot our drinks, took away our wine list after I asked to keep it, and then said, I'm sorry, I only slept 3 hours last night.
Our waiter actually said he would check with the chef, like they might force us to share our food.
The waiter was able to answer any questions I had about the wine or food.
I arrived with one other person at ~8:30 on a Wed night -- the hostess was very kind and showed me the reservation computer which showed that they were completely booked.
Well, literally 7 minutes later we were being served dinner, with no apologies from the server who was too scared to come to our table.
The staff is nice, but they have the awful job of having to sell bland food as amazing treats.
We had a late 9:30 pm reservation; when we arrived and went to be seated, there was some type of discrepancy since the hostess was missing in action.
The wait staff was all hanging at the bar, lounging around.
While dining on a delicate lamb carpaccio, and grilled skate wing, the owner explained that due to low lunch-time patronage, they may be discontinuing lunch altogether.
Despite him not being my designated server, he basically took over for our inexperienced waiter the rest of the dinner.
The service was great, the chef even gave me a complimentary dish.
Tension filled the air as the chief yelled at a waiter in the middle of the bar while in uniform and drinking.
then the manager gave us lemon juice instead of ceasar dressing for a ceasar salad which ruined the salad.
Midway through the meal the waiter came over and said we were being charged $40 a head since there were 7 of us, and they never said that when i made the reservation.
I excused myself from my table went downstairs to inform the hostess that I would like to suprise my dinner guest by recognizing his birthday in a very understated way.
We were served by two very rude waitresses who slammed every glass and dish they brought onto the table, and then got so caught up by hanging out at the bar that I eventually had to hunt them down to pay my bill.
The hostess kept me waiting 10 minutes (attempting to read seating chart which I assume was in cyrillic) before determining whether she could seat us.
A server came shortly after that with a cheeseburger, which is not what i ordered.
We didn't order-the waiter just kept piling the food in front of us.
Upon arrival I attempted to give a waiter my name (there doesn't seem to be a hostess) and tell him I had a 9pm reservation, but was told to just go get in line and wait for a table.
Food is fine but unremarkable, atmosphere is very noisy, especially for a date, and our waiter looked like he had never seen us before when we reminded him that we had ordered a second round of drinks 20 minutes earlier.
Servers struggle to explain the menu to those who can't tell an idli from a chapathi, but the mostly Indian clientele is completely at home with the vegetarian South Indian fare.
Had to constantly ask the waiter to top up water glasses, but generally service was ok.
As we sat waiting for our menus, we started noticing the frowns on the faces of the people around us, watching as patrons tried to flag down waiters without luck, asking for things like water.
The bar is available while you waiting for the table, the DJ is nice.
As the afternoon progresses, you'll see as many waitstaff as customers scurrying after food carts with bill cards in hand, clutching stacks of steamers back to their tables.
Even if their service was not top notch at all times, at least the wait staff was very accommodating and respectful.
Our waitress bought us a round of after drinks too.
after the main course the waitress brought desert menus and never came back.
The bread was served, one razor thin slice on our bread plate, by the waiter.
Our waitress was a bit cold but she was still attentive and food came quickly.
We ended up hanging out for a few hours at their bar with a staff that we felt like we've known for years.
To SM's credit, our waiter was eventually replaced and the matre d' offered us free dessert, but we're not going back there ever again.
Our server was a delight, she helped guide us through the menu with honest insight.
What I thought was a rip off was, when we were ordering, the waiter told us there was a minimum of food we can purchase.
- , the desserts are sinful, the moroccan hospitality evident in the wait staff's friendliness and there is an overall ambience that makes you want to stay all night!
Service was good, the waiter was a little flip, but we can deal with that.
We ordered one of the specials our decent waiter mentioned, and one of the chicken dishes off the menu.
One example: They literally took bread from my baby, after we ordered a brick oven pizza, not food (the waiter's words).
We ate here once and the waiter was very aggressive about pushing the specials instead of what was on the menu.
We recently visited Madiba for lunch, and our waitress was sweet but ineffective.
I politely asked the waitress to explain these charges noting that the menu was misleading and she got frustrated mad and then told her manager.
The wait staff are friendly, but they disappear after they take initial drink and food order.
had the $80 chefs tasting menu - was excellent -and we were stuffed - basically is a bit of all of their special dishes - one at a time - with sushi soup coming last.
I ordered a dirty martini that was not dirty at all-and when I asked the waitress to make it dirtier, instead of reshaking/making it at the bar, she broght me over some olive juice in a cup!?
last time, the waiter told my roommate he'd have to charge her $5 for mushrooms as one of her omelette choices (never heard that at my other favorite brunch places.
My date and I were both taken back by the lack of the friendly attitude from the owner of the restaurant.
My party felt like we got put in a dining room for tourist, which must have been the penalty box area for the disgruntled wait staff on duty.
The server (Jasmine) checked up on us periodically and was patient as she explained certain menu items.
Once seated we were greeted by a very rude waiter who threw menus at us and then snatched them away as we were ordering.
If you don't care about the wait staff as long as they bring you your drinks and dinner, then go to Opa.
Even though the place was more than half empty he refused to do so because we had already given our order to the waiter and a change of tables would cause too much confusion.
The food wasn't overwhelming, but was very tasty, and the space wasn't overcrowded or obnoxious - the waiters and waitresses were attentive and helpful, but not obtrusive.
Seemed like they got something wrong with every drink order Bartenders were def.
A few times at the bar I felt as though the Sushi chef an older gentleman was laughing at me and my girlfriend.
Though the wait staff was attentive, when the raw (really, not al dente) potatoes were brought to our server's attention, she listened but didn't respond.
Our waiter fast to get our drinks, aptz, and orders.
I naively thought dinner was served during the show, but the waiters don't come by once the shows start, so order your wine 30 mins before the show start time.
In addition to the two rounds of drinks, the bartender and owner were a hoot.
When I got home, there was a message on the machine because the owner realized that our waitress forgot to charge us for our wine.
The waitress could have been more specific when I asked for a wine suggestion.
The uptight female manager came up to our table and rudely asked us to get up because they had a party waiting to eat.
However, didnt take too long to get drinks and the hostess seated us promptly.
Interesting crowd for people watching - old school Italian music cranking - friendly Italian waitress brought us our wine garlic bread in no time.
They have possibly the worst service in New York I have waited until the waiter has finished his paper, begged for water and waited over an hour for my meal.
By the end of the meal, we were shaking hands with/hugging our waiter as we stumbled/rolled out the door.
The waitress at the bar was very nasty to me because she mistakenly took an order for thai ice tea from me when I asked for thai lemonade in a to-go cup.
The manager also refused to remove the drink from the check, suggesting that if we didnt like it, we could simply remove the corn ourselves.
The arrogant maitre'd was annoyed when i asked about sitting down those tables are for other reservations low and behold those tables were still open as my wife and I finished dinner.
the food is still awesome - the twist on mexican is perfect - but the service is terrible - from the apathetic hosts to the unbelievably slow servers.
Caravan can be a little slow sometimes, but more than makes up for it in the quality of the food and the care of wait staff.
Bland food, arroganrt waiters.
My group and I cancelled whatever drinks we ordered (no food order since there was NO wait staff) and left.
The waiters do not tell you that and our large party wound up with over $100 extra food because all members thought dessert, coffee/tea were included - which they lead you to believe - and they weren't.
had to ask the host for the check because the waitress was sitting at another table taking their order.
The kitchen staff either cannot or will not accomodate special diets which is surprising given that there are so many fine dining establishments that do have special menus to cater to vegetarians.
The server also forgot about our dessert.
The only thing that I was unhappy about was that one time, the restaurant received a delivery of supplies and the rolled it in through the dining area into the back kitchen, with the deliverymen shouting loud things to each other in chinese.
We sat at the bar and were constantly bumped by the waitress flying past; had fabulously fresh raw oysters with pieces of shell in every bite; lobsters rolls were tasty but the large pieces of meat were tough; the apple crumble was excellent but the ice cream was over-frozen and the stench of frying oil was nearly unbearable.
Reservations for parties under 5 people isn't allowed but their yummy cocktails and handsome waiters help soothe the pain.
Handsome baritone Nordic waiters patrol the room, proffering fresh-squeezed juices and $4-a-person pots of French press coffee.
The bartender said that they didn't have one, but did say, We have mixed drinks.
It seemed to take the new staff forever to figure out what they were doing; I had one nightmare of a brunch where the registers didn't seem to work and it literally took over an hour to get our check.
The waitress was slow and forgot drinks and food we ordered.
The waiter was not attentive he gave me the wrong drink twice and the bill for three people who had appertizers, a drink and an entree was $200.
A bustling crew of sage green-shirted servers whisk plates of luncheon and light dinner favorites to power lunchers, tourists, and ladies who lunch.
When one purchases a bottle of wine, it's fairly common practice for a server to come by and refill your glass, but not the case here; 2.
Service: Below Average, the staff joked stood around in the dinning room joking around with each other.
Although the dining area is a bit small you'll feel at home as the owner is very friendly and talkative.
Perhaps it was because the 20% tip was already added to the bill, but the waiter brought us plain gazpacho without any of the other ingredients described on the menu; later, when we complained, he brought us saucers of garnish instead of new bowls of the soup properly prepared.
The host came by and told us that they made a mistake and would have to seat us at a two-person table.
The waitress apologized for the long wait and said they would give us some free drinks or desert since they forgot about our orders but we never received anything and by the time we got the bill we just wanted to pay and leave.
When my family and I visited, we were hearded in and out of the restaurant like cattle; not once did our waiter ask how are meal was, and the waitress mixed up our steaks.
Our waiter (the one with the Spanish accent) was a bit pre-occupied with other things- hardly coming around to the table and nowhere to be seen most of the time.
The only time the waitress paid any attention to us was when she took our order and at the end of our meal to ask if we wanted dessert (by then we had already packed up our leftovers and were waiting for change from our bill).
The atmosphere is perfect, whether sitting down for dinner or just having a drink at the bar and engaging the friendly bartenders in converasation.
The server came to us and was sooo hot, he went over the menu and specials with us.
The Service was en pointe and I felt like the servers were always aware of our wants, whether it was punctual refill of water, new napkins, etc.
This is the kind of place that is suppose to have pushy waiters and a loud atmosphere.
Although the food was good, the way our waiter treated us was so rude and bad-mannered that it almost ruined our night and he even asked us to give him a better tip!!!
Since I listened closely, I know they were a party of 2 without any reservation The manager then offered to seat us but we left.
The feeling of unwelcomeness was especially prevalent due to the fact that our waiter hovered over our table and immediately cleared the table of dishes and glasses, some of which were still full in order to get us out the door ASAP.
Another hour waiting for our food, we spoke to the manager, he told us he would give us a discount off our bill.
Went to Butter on Monday night for a friend's birthday dinner at like 11:00pm, the kitchen was supposedly closed, but we spoke to the manager and we were seated promptly.
Unless you like getting bumped by waiters and people walking by, do not sit at a middle table.
not to mention that the waiter offered putting a scoop of ice cream on my dessert.
After a few minutes, seeing we were without menus, a slightly more pleasant waitress approached us and explained that the manageress had asthma and wasn't in a good mood.
The servers didn't know what tables the meals were going to, it was a complete comedy show.
The only other negative, we found the waiter to be slightly pompous, and when I asked him some very basic wine questions, he was lost.
Our waiter was courteous and knew the menu well, though he was a little pushy with the bottles of wine.
Well I can't tell you how the food was because the moment we walked in, the single waiter was extremely rude and told us to wait outside while he cleared a table (in the middle of winter) because he was busy.
The manager came personally to apologize and to my surprise, he brought me the drink, a big chocolate chip cookie, and a bag of chips!!!
I went anyway and was greeted by the rude owner who practicly ripped our outside drink from our hands (although we were trying to throw it out anyway.
I have never been to an establishment that boasts traditional French service that basically throws food at you; waiters not only reach across the table but drip wine and water all over their diners.
i just wish they wld drop some staff though, sometimes you feel like your being stalked by waiters, waiters helper, waterperson, busperson, food runner, supervisors, managers.
She's watching your table, helping the staff candy to your eyes.
Once seated the waiter took our drink orders only to return 10 minutes later with the wrong drinks.
Lastly, after spending a little over an hour and most of that time waiting for our food to arrive the manager barked at us to leave to make room for another party that had been waiting for 25 minutes!
This Restaurant was very  Ask to the waiter or waitress to give you a table in the back room where all the romance of the place is situated with a so-called chimney!!
This past Memorial day weekend was hot and I asked the waiter why was the air condition not working and he responded doens't know why.
On each of my several visits, the crowd is local, professional, family and those who are not familiar with the cuisines of India are deftly walked through the menu by management.
Delicious appetizers and entrees, our server recommended a wonderful bottle of wine, and we couldn't resist dessert.
After I have my dinner I try to talk to the manager and let him know that he had very good workers and that he should be more considerate with them and the answer that I got from him was (THey can leave I don't care).
Its great for people who want to try Korean food, but can't understand the servers or the menu on 32nd St.
This much heralded restaurant brought my wife and I some excitement as we walked in the door, but we were met with an awkward maitre'd who barely spoke to us at all and just seemed standoff-ish.
It took the waiter over a 1/2 hour to come over to tell us the specials.
even when they informed us they were out of the port we chose to accompany our dessert, the manager made sure that we were offered an even better bottle that wasn't even featured on the menu.
Many meals were delivered by two servers, besides having a waiter to oversea the process.
Obviously bz place, greeting was less than welcoming, service was adequate from less than friendly waiters, steak for 2 was anything but spectacular served with sauce that's better suited for seafood than meat.
Anyway we get a table and order some appetizers from one of the waitresses who was pleasently nice.
When we proceeded to order our food, the waitress interrupted and told us that maybe we had ordered enough for now.
I have been coming here for several years and know that the staff and bartender would be there with my favorite drinks and dishes I like to eat and drink on any given night.
We were a bit chatty so it took us a while to decide what to order, but when we made it abundantly clear we were ready (closed the menu, looked around for our waiter) he was slammed from the recent filling of the space.
When asked what the waitress recommended she just named a few things off the menu without saying why.
The waiter, who was missing when we wanted to place our order, hovered over us throughout the meal, as if in a hurry to get us out of there.
When we finally got to order, we were told the bartender wasn't there, so we couldn't order any drinks.
I asked the captain to bring the food in separate bags and he loudly said, Oh, I guess you are not getting lucky tonight.
Our waitress was rather un-friendly, seemed annoyed that we didn't want appetizers and we waited 15 minutes before our wine arrived.
It says it on the menu and the servers explain it to you as soon as you sit down so I'm surprised by how many people on this site complain about the portion sizes.
I had to stare out waitress down to get our check and also we were charge.
Anyhow, there were a lot of Japanese people seated at the bar, eating chatting up the chefs, surely that's a good sign of authentic sushi.
The servers are constantly in your face asking if you want another drink (mine was half full).
Sam and the staff at Rialto were so accomodating and gave us a dinner event we will always remember.
Our waiter brought out three main courses, but the fourth wasn't ready so we had to wait for 10 minutes for the last dish to arrive, but they were very nice and gave us free red pepper hummus while we waited.
After dinner we ordered a hookah and after 20 minutes waitress comes by and tried to take it away because she claims our table is reserve for another group in 10 minute.
of course i haven't mentioned the fact that we walked in on time for our reservation only to wait in the empty bar for over half an hour, being seated when we reminded the hostess that we were still waiting.
We started ordering wine and, since we don't know much about it, we decided to let the waiter choose for us; we were pleased with his recommendation.
I dined there on a Wednesday night, the restaurant was practically empty, and we had to ask our waiter for everything, the menu, more water, the check, etc.
i always get the apple pie, but the past two times i visited, the waiter burnt the pie while he was supposed to warm it up.
When we mentioned that we had theatre tickets, the waiter made certain that our dishes were served promptly and courteously.
Server Sean Toussaint suggested specials and specialties worth the $$$ price.
Don't ask for a menu- take the trip with your waiter who eloquently (and vividly) describes dishes until he sees your eyes light up.
We decided to ask for our check for the wine we had and the waiter became completely annoyed at us!
The not-so-friendly-cigarette-reeking waiter asked if we had any questions then when we did ask, he rolled his eyes and covered his face with the menu to say something to a passing coworker.
After dining there twice, all the waiters will remember you and what you ordered the last time you were there!
Love the pizza here (although the slices aren't as fresh at 3am, but who's that picky when you're drunk), and there's plenty of other good stuff.
the waitress was surly -- refused to bring sweetner for my tea!!
With a chef from Liguria, Italy, authentic Neapolitan brick oven pizza and one of the most impressive Italian wine lists I've ever seen, this was the real deal!
When we got there (6 women), we were not even allowed in when a staff member with a bad attitude wearing a suit told us that we absolutely needed a reservation (yes, we've gone from an artsy community to this)!
The wait staff didn't bother to refill my water until I had finish mine and was almost done with my husband's glass too.
We were not rushed at all, and the manager comped drinks at the bar so that we would vacate our table for a birthday girl who had to wait.
my sister asked for iced tea twice and the waitress said they didn't have.
First, we waited 40 minutes for our food, but after a thrity minute wait, the waitress asked me to clarify what I had ordered (I ordered off their menu, with no changes).
The waiter was nice once he got to us, it took about 5 minutes to get a glass of water and someone to get us started even though it was very slow.
When I requested a change to the non-smoking section, the waiter replied that there were no open tables.
I would love the owner to consider hosting a 'tango bar' once - twice a week.
When we got our bill the drinks were full priced and when we asked, our waitress said that there is no happy hour on the roof.
My only suggestion would be to avoid long waits for food by adding extra servers when there are large groups.
a drink or two went by, but as we slowly realized our wait had become an hour from the promised 20 min, the server noted upon our inquiry that they recognized and remembered us and would seat us soon- rolling eye look- matched by a tone protesting the uncouth annoyance.
The managers aren't snobby for wanting reservations -- it's a new restaurant and they're trying to manage the flow of diners.
However, it was a very long wait (over 45 min) and I confronted the hostess who stated that she could not find me at the bar and she had seated 6 other parties before me.
Our waitress recommended the coffee flan for dessert, and we didn't regret it.
Our waiter was apparently angry to have to be serving, because it took him 15 minutes to even bring water, let alone take a drink order (it was early on in the day and the restaurant was not even 50% full, so he was NOT busy).
We waited 15 minutes for a menu, another 20 for a tea, another 15 for an appetizer, then when the plates came out, the waitress had to ask me what I'd ordered.
Our waiter was a real pro; knew a lot about ingredients and allowed us to take our time.
Expect to stand around for a while before one of the waiters desides that they can be bothered to actually get you to a seat.
The staff were rude and rushed us through our meal, clearing plates and laying down dessert menus while others were still eating their main courses.
Suddenly the manager, came to our table yelling absolutely no way we can have a drink after dinner becuase he has tables waiting Just to be clear we spent over $70 and had 1 drink each, we used the table for about 1hour and 15 minutes.
Half way through the meal we did not have refills on our waters, even though our waiter passed the table many times and he never stopped to check on us or to ask if we were pleased with the entrees.
This is also when the waiter told us that half the menu was sold out.
The server was condescending and was unable to provide assistance with menu selections.
They later told us that our waiter had to fix the 'computer' - that was the reason he couldn't bring us our drinks.
Our server (after 4 reminders) finally got around to getting our cocktail orders during the meal (at a time when the establishment was not full).
After waiting an hour and a half, a delivery man - with heavily bleeding gums - told me not to worry, that my meal had been replaced with fresh food, and that my old order had been RE-SERVED to another customer.
We were directed to a table by a member of staff, which we were then informed was reserved, and lost our seats at the bar, all this after spending upwards of $30 each on very expensive drinks over a two-hour period.
Although when I went to eat dinner at Bombay Talkie on a crazy busy night, my waiter was extremely helpful through the menu, polite and polished.
Then the waiter acted indignant when we called him out for bring us the wrong (later) vintage of wine we picked out.
Then, when we ordered from a regular menu, and told the waiter, that we are in a hurry to make the show, his response was So what do you want me to do ?
Every time I eat there I feel as if the chef and waitstaff have cooked, prepared and served a meal as if I am the only customer/guest.
After lunch, we sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender who was also very nice.
The place was nice and the bartenders were friendly, but the cocktail girl was rude, obnoxious, and over charging all of us.
We were seated promptly and brought rolls and water but then were made to wait much too long before our beverage order was taken and then much much too long before our waiter came back for a food order.
The waiter was pleasant and I thought how bad could someone screw up basic Italian food?
We were first greeted by a very friendly hostess who asked if we had reservations - even though we didn't they were VERY accommodating - we sat at the bar and spoke to the VERY nice bartender who recommended a GREAT wine and gave us some brucetta to munch on while we waited.
Wait staff is seemingly non-existant, and food servers are way too agressive - our food was thrown on the table, and even knocked a member of my party in the head with a plate with little acknowledgement.
We had to ask for water even after we were asked what type we preferred, and then the busboy spilled it while he was pouring it out.
Trish, our waitress was really great - the food was mediocre.
The food is pretty good, and so is the service, though on my first visit I told the waitress I wanted my tuna black-and-blue and she had no idea what that was.
Unlike some of the other reviews here, the reservation was upheld, the waiter took the time to explain each dish and frequently asked if we wanted more of anything (which we did, several times).
In addition, our waiter seemed to have short-term memory loss because he kept forgetting to bring us our drink order even after I asked him on three separate occasions.
After arriving an hour early for our reservation for 2 and politely asking for a table near the band we were promptly seated at one of the worst tables in the place.
I agree with the other poster who wrote about the service: the waiter challenged every single dish we ordered with a special (I've never had a more money hungry waiter) and after waiting 20 minutes for the check we had to call the manager over; who was unapologetic.
After all that, the waiter tried to backpedal saying its too hard to time the cooking of miso soup with the sushi bar offerings.
That bastion of authentic Mexican food in Spanish Harlem that earned raves by white reviewers, leading other gringos to nervously venture to Spanish Harlem and pretend they're trendy to pay too much for food that is only marginally better than the place around the corner.
We sat, missing a place setting for a while before the waitress came to ask if we wanted water and then ran away.
The last two didn't come to the people who ordered them until they already had there food ( in which then we had to remind the staff of).
When I walked back to the counter, the two staff people immediately retreated to the back room, glanced back at me attempting to get their attention and immediately returned to wasting time.
The bartender ignored us for 10 minutes before asking what we'd like to drink although we were the only people waiting for a table when we walked in.
The head waiter made some lame excuse about how the chef had asked the hostess to revise the menu but it had not been changed.
We had to flag the waitress down to get a drink refill and waited an extrodinarily long time for our entrees.
I can't speak on the food, but I went there for a show the other week and here is my experience: one of the friendliest servers ever (no attitude); the drinks were avg.
The owner was rude to us from the moment we sat down until he told us we had to leave because he had another table waiting, and this despite ordering the pricier entrees from the menu and a bottle of wine that we hadn't yet finished.
Nothing beats being served platters of shrimp and wings and pitchers of beer, by the HOTTEST waitstaff in NY!!!!
When we followed the waiter to get back the card, the Manager explained that their machine did work, but someone else's bill was charged on our card (total charge=$140).
Even with reservations, checking in, and a generally quiet night, the hostess forgot that we were there and gave our table to her friends.
I had to ask the waiter a couple of times to clear our empty glasses.
Waiter had to lean on my husband to give people next to us their food.
The wait staff pushed us to get desserts immediately after we finished our main course and we had to continuously tell them we are not ready yet.
There was only one server on duty and we waited a while for menus.
Evening started out nice w/ complimentary glass of champagne, but turned sour as mussels were extremely overcooked, steak came in kid size portion smothered with sauce and owner recommended a wine special off the standard wine menu that was double the price of the most expensive bottle but made no effort to describe the wine as extremely special or significantly more expensive that what they typically serve.
' When I reasoned with them that my dining partner already received her hot entree and was halfway done eating, and all I ordered was two rolls, the wait staff finally got the idea that maybe they should be trying to get me my order.
Had an OK dinner that was made better by the attention the owners pay to the patrons.
) Service was good not great, waiters stood around,didn't ask how everything was.
he politely asked about what happened, we told him about the hostess behaviour, the manager apologized for the her behavior and treated us to a drink at the bar.
Aside from the fact the maitre de claimed the dining room was 'full', we were seated at a great table overlooking the lobby of the hotel and ordered the 5 course tasting menu.
The wait staff was attentive without being overbearing, and our waiter gave thoughtful advice on dishes that would be suitable for the children.
We (naturally) asked for a discount when the bill came, and our waitress disappeared for a moment and offered us.
Once we eventaully got seated (all tables are practically on top of each other), we were hustled through our meal by a waitstaff that clearly knows how quickly they need to turn the table over.
When we were finally seated about half an hour after my reservation, the waitress took her time taking our order.
impressive balcony seating and while they forgot to give us the cold appetizers, the waiter and maitre'd more than made up for it by being most accomodating to us.
The dessert was as good as the waiter said it would be.
After asking several different people find our waiter, he returned to say he couldn't find any wine and begged us to order sake instead.
When we asked if the waiter could put the lights back on, he said:we have this complaint every night but the owner thinks it's more 'Parisian'!
The high light was the fondue, that we never got because again the server said the kitchen was too busy.
The waiters have been there for YEARS and they know their steak is amazing.
When the manager was asked for things did imporve but 2 hours to get our meal.
The Food Chef Tom Kearney (Blue Hill, Jean-Georges) presides over the contemporary, pared-down menu.
Service was slow and spotty; had to flag the waiter down many a time to get drink and food orders in.
We were a large group and would highly recommend all the drinks and foodThe manager on duty was understanding that our friends were very late and held our reservation.
The wait staff is slow, full of attitude and forgettful--often taking 20 minutes to bring another round of food and drinks.
We waited half an hour just to get menus, and watched another table of 10 people leave because they had been ignored by the (single) waiter.
If you don't mind interacting with sour-puss employees, then by all means, enjoy the treats at Sweet Melissa.
Our meal was interrupted several times by the arguments between our waiter and the maitre 'd.
for ANYONE to come and take our dessert order (we had previously seen our waitress going outside for a cigarette break and never coming back).
not only were we waiting for half an hour with reservations, once we got seated we waited another 15+ minutes for the waiter to come and take out drink menu.
Evidently, our waiter went to the Mediterrean for our humus pita because it took about 25 minutes.
For spending over $100 per person for dinner, i would think that the waiter would put my plate of food down for me instead of handing me my dish.
Called to make a reservation and b/c the man who answered was so nice decided to chance it.
Once we had our menus we were nearly assaulted by wait staff asking if we were ready to order.
The staff is constantly disappearing from the restaurant, making it impossible to get drink refills or to get the check.
They bought the same surly staff, it still took way too long for food, drink, ANY SERVICE and the food is still $ 12.
We didn't see the solitary waitress after seating ourself for over 10 minutes.
The hostess was inefficiently seating people and disappeared for minutes at a time, letting the line grow to 15+ people waiting to put their names on the list.
The cultured wait staff were accommodating and helped explain and pronounce the items off the menu.
Our waitress was pleasant but slow, and the food is simply not good enough to be treated like a nuisance.
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.
Although we were seated right away and the waiter brought menus promptly as well as drink, he was almost never at our table despite being at the other tables right next to ours.
The waiter was conspicuously eyeing our table the entire meal and there was a lot of scurrying by the wait staff in general.
We were rudely told by the waiter that chips are only available at the bar.
AND, the waitstaff likes to lick its fingers when cutting cakes/pies and serves hot and cold drinks by holding the glass or cup around the brim/top.
Its not cheap, it was $10 for a burger and fries, and when i was there, the waiter had dropped a FULL glass of coke on a patron, soaking her through!
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
They lost our reservations and the manager quickly came over and apologized and then gave us a free round of drinks and free dessert.
Our waitress brought him a regular coke instead of a diet coke, and the salsa had OIL floating at the top.
For example, the last time I was there the bartender seemed visibly irritated that I would ask him for a drink instead of the waitress.
I went for lunch and the staff does not welcome you upon entering.
We asked for a side of dressing but the waiter told us that all the salads just had oil and vinegar so we should just use the oil and vinegar that was on the table.
Our meal was capped of with the waiter rudely saying he needed the table for other customers.
but the Server informed us that they wanted to make the soup their own and that she hopes we like it.
The hostess had us wait in the bar while our table was set up and we ordered what had to be the best mojitos in the city.
The server was dutiful yet insincere, the brunch drinks above average.
I prefer to sit at the bar as I don't have to listen to loud, boring conversations from the next table who always seem to be friends of the owner.
I went there on my 2nd day in New York ever for a quick lunch and ended up staying and chatting with the owners wife and a waiter, Javi for two hours.
My nice waitress even came running out of the restaurant to hand me a tiny box I had forgotten on the table.
While waiting for a table, tried to get a drink from a bartender who seemed more interested in arguing with his waiters.
The chef insisted that the meat was cooked properly!?
We were coldly greeted by a hostess and wait staff who, in spite of our reservation, did not want to seat any of us, including the elderly, until our entire party had arrived.
The birthday girl's dessert included a candle the staff came by with birthday wishes.
The chef will not alter any of the three tasting menus.
Sure the food was - as always - very good, but we were quite outrageous about the waitress.
After our disappointing meal and terrible service we asked to speak to the manager (who was sitting alone having a glass of wine) when we were told he was too busy to speak to us!
When I asked to speak to a manager, I was sent to voicemail, and I still haven't received a callback.
Yesterday they had numerous bartenders as well as servers and the place wasn't packed and it still took 1/2 an hour to make a martini.
The waiter handed us menus consisting of about 7 entrees, and after telling us the specials, informed us that there was no chicken.
We had to remind the waiter to pour our wine (white) and then he didn't show us the label.
The food and beer make up for it, but it would be nice if the staff weren't such buzz kills!
The waiters seemed annoyed we all ordered the restaurant week menu and were going to cut into their tips.
my waitress was unable to answer my questions about the menu, and forgot to put in my order.
Our waiter was pretty much non-existent and when he did come to our table he practically tossed our plates and wine glasses in front of us.
Although my waiter had about as much personality as a dead fish, I loved the great solid food and would definately go back.
I was disappointed to hear another waiter (or it could've been the owner) was reading completely different specials (most of which I would've wanted to try if I didn't overhear at the end of our meal) to the table next to us.
Forget about the staff and go for the food and pleasant, if a bit cramped Lancaster, Pennsylvania like decor for comfort.
Although it lacks the patina of places like Peter Luger's and Sparks, it still has a steakhouse's telltale wood paneling, chalkboard specials and decorative wine bottles.
We waited over 30 minutes to get our drinks (which were brought over my the manager) and we could not find anyhting that looked interesting on the menu.
Went there a few months ago, and while the food was really good, and I was ready for it to be pricey, the one thing that bothered me was the waiter was standing in a corner watching us eat.
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.
The waiter took my boyfriend's order, snatched away the menus and stormed away from the table without even looking at me.
Went for lunch the bartenders were great, also they had a DJ playing music during the day, there was a Huge screen tv playing music videos and a bunch of other tvs with all the sports you could look at.
I used to live in Japan, and have had some pretty good raw fish, but I was blown away by the Chef's tasting plate, which includes 6 appetizers including a stunning octopus portion and some incredible sashimi.
Our waiter was a bit weird as well, but the lounge area looked like a nice place to get a drink after work.
The service was really bad at several points our waiter would just leave for a cigarette for like 10 minutes while we waited for him to get us another drink or even pay the bill.
While the hostess claimed to have lost my reservation, we were there early enough to only have to wait about 10 minutes to seat our party of seven.
deserts were slow to order as waiters passed us twice, even with the menus closed.
12/24/03  Dinner was ok, service was so- so,the worst part was the hostess - we made reservations a month before Christmas Eve for three people, you would think the table would be large enough for all three of us.
The final blow came when the waitress scorned our 16% tip for the meal.
Only problem was - an older gentleman (well-dressed but a little enebriated) chose to sit down right next to me - despite the fact that all 15 other seats were free - order himself a martini, and then describe how dry and dissapointing the burger was when he ordered it a few days ago.
Bartender made a bad drink for me and I sent it back and was charged for it.
The menu was in Italian- might as well have been in Esperanto;that put us at the mercy of the waiter for recommendations.
We had to flag down the waiter even to refill water glasses!
Waiter spilled a decent amount of water on my friend's plate -and then walked away - didn't remove the plate!
our waiter noticed it was my bday w/o me saying, and brought me cake w/ candles.
In the front bar, boisterous neighbors and friends share bottles of wine; the large dining room, with its lovely painted ceiling and oversized portrait of a portly chef, is the destination for serious eating.
staff is still working out their kinks and learning about the menu but no real complaints.
Service was unbelievably on target down to the smallest detail; our waiter invited us to sample a new desert under consideration for their menu and a new line of ice wines.
In addition, the manager refused to come over to apologize - but told the waitress to offer us TWO desserts on the house- when there were FOUR people dining.
The waiter disappeared after dropping off the food so I had no choice but to eat it as is.
I did not find the wait staff to rude at all, how involved do you really want them in your meal right?
Half way through the meal my husband had to go to the bar to order his own beer, since the server never came back.
To the amusement of our server, I wrote everything down, lest I forget a single morsel (about 21 different dishes).
I ordered a medium Cub burger and it came out well done, not that my server would have noticed since we didn't see her again until she brought the check.
The waiter spent a long time telling us about the menu (and more about his own life history in the process.
The waiter nearly yelled at me when I asked for more water.
When I asked for a particular drink, the waitress gave me dirty look and annoyed b/c they didn't know what it was.
then, the waiter had nerve to charge me for the fruit salad and bloody mary (which we didn't drink) that came with the omelet (brunch special).
I had the waiters bring back so much meat that that asked me if I wanted Flank steak for dessert.
The waiter kept pestering us for our order even though we were among the last diners.
Waiter suggests a beer, and offers to bring a small glass, to taste it and see if I like it, before I even order the beer!
We fully relied on our very capable waiter for choices of the menu and we were not disappointed.
The waiter didn't know the menu, didn't bring more than one item at a time, and put some orders in twice with the kitchen.
Into our appetizer, an adjacent table became available, and we asked if we could use it, but the waiter said it most likely was being used.
To start with - the maitre'd forgot our reservation and then when it came time to sit us down - he told us we only had an hour.
At least the entertainment was free, as we were able to witness one customer wooing a waitress, and another being drenched in milk.
The service was good, but not excellent; however, the waiter was initially huffy with me when my guest was only 5 minutes late, threatening to make me move!
When our entrees came, at least 3 or 4 waiters / waitresses came by at different times to wish us bon apetit.
the server absolutely did not know what in the world he was talking about when we aske questios about the menu, and he barely spoke English.
The waiters actually roll their eyes when you order something, as if you are imposing on them by ordering food.
Our waiter had started to circle around our table like a shark after our 2nd dish, taking out plates when we were not even done.
My reservation for 2 was during lunch and it seemed that because I was literally 2 minutes late, the hostess felt the need to seat every party before mine.
We had to wait an hour before our food was served, then another hour inbetween courses, all the while whilst the staff were naughtily hiding in an attempt to avoid our 'where's out food?'
It took a long time for the waiter to bring the check and we had to flag him down.
Went the next day for lunch - menu too pricey for lunch and the waiter was the WORST !!
when someone from our table of 5 asked the waitress for refill on water, she comes back and fills only that person's glass, leaving the rest of the table with almost empty glasses.
We told the manager it was not worth a few appetizers to be treated that way and left.
We would have to flag down the bored looking wait staff to refill our tea.
Watch out for the overworked, stressed out waitress who dumps tapa dishes on the table and leaves w/out announcing what it is.
I would not recommend this place until they get a new staff that can complement the food.
The food was pretty good, but due to our large size (~16) the manager asked us to limit our appetizers to just 3 selections b/c he didn't want to overburden his cooks.
Our waitress seemed less than happy about the prix fixe dinner choices and at one point said, Do you really need to hear the specials?
Then the staff behind the buffett just haven't gotten their groove yet, so you order your food and wait five minutes while it sits behind the glass on a plate, getting cold.
The bar tender didn't know where the tea was, waiters started making the drinks if the bar tender wasn't around.
The waitress/hostess seemed a bit sad when we told her we weren't ordering dessert (those arepas are deceptively filling!
Nice decor and an extensive menu lured me in, but the horrible service and rude staff drove me out.
The only problem my party found was that when people asked for knives and forks (there were only chopsticks on the table) the waitress laughed at them.
I have a litany of complaints -- being over-charged for wine that I didn't order, shady waiters, so-so food that arrived at the table luke warm, main course portion sizes barely large enough to be appetizer sizes, lack of fabulosity that Mr.
Unlike the reviewer before me, what made me KEEP going back was the great reception I received from the bouncers and I needed several cocktails to endure the waitstaff.
We finally flagged down another server who brought us more to drink, and then they took forever with the check.
The waitress forgot our coffee, took forever to take our order, never checked in with us after the food came and when we were done, didn't bring us the check for the longest time.
The wait staff was better the second time around and our water glasses were always full.
Waitress kept trying to get us to order more drinks while apologizing but wouldn't even bring bread to keep us from starving.
Both appetizers arrived cold/luke-warm, which we had to send back, only to have the waiter tell us that one was supposed to be cold.
The Food Consulting Chef Douglas Rodriguez's forte is blending the diversity of traditional Latin cuisine with modern culinary chic: A celery sorbet cools the spicy-citrus bite of lobster; shrimp seviche and crunchy green plantains coat thick, juicy halibut resting on sweet plantain hash; and tart tomato escabeche moistens a chewy skirt steak.
Waiter dropped check on table while I was in the middle of handing my wife her anniversary present.
The waiter came back after I had finished my appetizer to correct himself and let me know that it wasn't vegetarian (chicken stock) after all.
Food took over an hour despite at least two chasers, we had to track the server down to get extra drinks, the manager seemed to try and deliberately mislead us about the reason behind the delay and in the end the food was poor.
The waiters are nice, but weren't particularly good - waited forever to order and resented not being told that my dinner companion and I had ordered enough for a table of 10 (given the size of the sushi).
50, I got the Paella Marinera which was beyond filling in itself, but before it even came, the waitstaff provided more than ample appetizers for my group that by the time that the meal came to us, we were so stuffed, we could barely finish up the meal.
I thought the bar was fair in terms of decor, but how long do you have wait at the bar before a bartender with an attitude (he wasn't rude, but not friendly) makes you an awful drink, but food was delightful and music light and tasty as well.
The Food A good way to judge a Thai spot is by its green curry: The all-Thai staff here fashions it spicy and smooth, filled to bursting with meat and thin-sliced bamboo shoots.
I don't know why people complain about the service - our waiter brought our drinks and food out promptly.
Once they took our wine order, it took 45 minutes for it to arrive, even though the waiter was talking to a patron next to us.
When I went back to the hostess (yes it was past the time we had for our original reservation) - she said that it was fine to get seated but we needed to leave in an hour.
The restaurant has a somewhat unique decor, with portrait of the owner meditating and books about meditation.
Food turned out to be descent, but the waitress disappeared from the moment we placed the order untill she came back with the check.
We asked for more coffee, water and couldn't even get that from our server.
We made a reservation for 5:30pm (20 people) and people were still arriving at 5:45 (over half the group was there) when the manager came over and literally yelled at us for not being on time saying it was a busy time for him, when in fact there were several empty tables throughout the restaurant.
Even as a stranger, the service at the bar was excellent as was the wait staff who continuously checked back to see if I was okay while waiting for my party.
The waiter kept coming up and asking to take our plates while we were still eating and the manager stood and stared at us through half our meal!
The restaurant was recently taken over by new managment and, having eaten there under the prior management, I can say that the quality of the dishes has improved.
But when the bartender messes up the returned drinks something is wrong.
The waitress lost some points for not refilling our champagne glasses.
Service was good except the waitress brought over the check before I asked her.
The waiter (someone I know has been working there since it was just LCB) POURED MY WINE FROM THE DIRTY GLASS INTO A CLEAN ONE AND SERVED IT TO ME!
The only blemish was our waitress, who left us with empty drinks for quite a long time.
The waitress took forever to take our order, we waited almost an hour for our appetizers, and then she asked us whether she even put the order in -- as if we would even know.
since it looks like everyone's already familiar with the rude hostess and long wait for a table (even with a reservation), i'll skip that part.
Waiters and busboys were taking our water glasses and the tip tray off the table before we had counted the change.
After our meal,the manager, even took some of his time to sit with us and give us a lesson in Sake 101.
Adding insult to injury, the waiter had to ask for the wine bottle by number (where are we?
The server was so busy the night we visited that she forgot to put in our food order.
The waiter was singing while taking our order- the food arrived 30 minutes later and the food was good, but the mules Frites were cold, the steak had to be returned twice-the spinach looked like it was grass from Union Square park with hunks of garlic in it-totally Unacceptable.
I asked the waitress what this was for and her responses were as follows: We put in an extra shot, We had to use ice in the drink, and It must have been the computer.
The service was not great, the wait staff were not clear on the ingredients and or preparation details of the meals.
We should have had the entire restaurant, but the manager let some random lady sit up at the bar because she was a regular.
In addition guys, please hire some waitstaff who know both English and your menu.
the water guy was extremely attentive, thank god he was because we had to ask him for our waitress many times: for ordering our food, more drinks, dessert and check.
The waiter returned and said the bartender refused to take my drink back because there was nothing wrong with it and I would have to pay for it.
They ran out of the drinks my friends ordered, but the staff was eager-to-please and much appreciated.
We were seated quickly (and had reservations, but they didnt seem to be absolutely necessary) and our waitress offered much insight into menu bests and worsts.
The sexy waiter suggested the Pineapple Basil ( I Know is sounds yucky, but MMMM) Martini.
I don't understand the other negative reviews of the service because we had amazing waiter.
When the bill came, the waiter snatched it back so he could add the $3 difference to the wine.
Our server seemed out of it, and drinks took 15 minutes to arrive.
the waiter didn't recommen any special for the night, didn't come back to the table to check if everything is okay, didn't even offer me the dessert menu at the end.
After I had complained to a bouncer (the manager would not see me) a waiter was sent over and did get us our drinks.
) And don't forget the svc, those waiters stare at you your entire meal, just waiting for you to put your fork down and they snatch the plate away in a second.
After we in fact moved to the bar, and I told the waitress which bottle we wanted - the one we had been drinking - we were told we had to order off the limited daily specials list.
The manager came over to our table at the end of our entree course to get our review.
I love the food, and have gone back several times, but each time the waitress is a little nastier.
The server rolled his eyes when we ordered only an entree per person (with no appetizers), spoke curtly to us, and ignored our requests for more water etc.
The wait staff while attentive did nothing to address the hair that was found in one of our dishes.
There were three parties of two standing in the front entrance looking like bumbling idiots while not a single host, waiter, or manager attended to us.
I understand its a very busy night of the week but it is unacceptable that I was hung up on by the hostess twice (I also called back and she refused to answer the phone for 15 minutes) and was told that I should have picked up my food instead of having it delivered.
Your drink is at your fingertips and you don't have to wait for the waitress to come back with your cocktail.
The Captain was showing his impatience for a crowded Monday night and the dinner I was served was not prepared the way he told me it would be.
Food was fine, and the place is pretty cool, but the waitstaff was slow and pretty clueless.
It took an hour for us to order, another hour and 15 min to get our entree's I had to go to the bar to order my champange, and carry it back myself, the waiter got our entrees mixed up and placed them in the wrong place and sat there and watched me switch them around.
-4 waiters bustling around though no table was actually being helped -25 minutes to take our order -15 minutes to get the drinks we order -another 20 minutes to get our food -NO apology from the waiter In between our lunch, a man burst out shouting in anger at the lousy service (he asked for ketchup 20 minutes ago and never got it).
not only did we not get our 'bombay' fries until after the entire meal, but we then had to wait nearly an hour for our inattentive waiter to bring our check, and only after we flagged him down.
She walked away in a huff, and had the BUSBOY pass on the same message: you can't order coffee because you've already paid (have these people never heard of someone changing their mind?
What a pleasant surprise to have found a restaurant where you can sit at the bar and feel like a glamourpuss, yet whose staff and even other patrons make you feel like you are already a family friend.
And the waitstaff has very little knowledge of the food, they served me the wrong dish and no one could identify what it was that they gave me, someone said pork chop, someone said lamb, and then they insisted it should be fine since it was the same price.
It appears to be a charming french outdoor bistro, and the food wasn't bad, but the waiters were clearly tired of dealing with tourists, and didn't handle us with care.
The wait staff was not as attentive as I would have liked, we had to ask several times for water and refills of water, and after the food was served, no one returned to check on us.
1) they gave us the wrong table had to wait 10 minutes until they gave us the one we wanted 2) had to wait 15 minutes for a waiter 3) ordered chicken and brocolli.
When the food came, it was almost good, but the lack of AC, bad service, and overall apathetic staff, from the HOST, to the MANAGER to the WAITER, ruined the experience.
The wine list was had some of my favorites which I have not seen anywhere in New York, and when I clumsily spilled both water and wine all of the my table the waitress and manager were there in a flash jovially helping me clear up the mess.
We went there on New Year's Day around 7 pm without a reservation and were able to get a table right away thanks to the very accomodating hostess.
You'll have to wait for a long time if you're not in with the management or Fernando, but it's worth it, have some campari and cinzano at the bar!
Not only did the food take an eternity to come out; but the waiter never checked in, explained the delay for the food, or refreshed our drinks.
We sat for 20-40min without water or bread and were basically ignored by the waitstaff.
Since the waiter NEVER checked on us during the meal, she never had the chance to ask for hoisin.
Nonetheless, our waiter gave us prompt service and a smile every time he came over to take an order, bring us drinks, or check up on how we were doing.
The owner circles the place asking patrons if their meals are fine.
small portions, average food 6) we ask for the check, the waiter says, ok, and 5 minutes later asks if we want coffee or dessert.
Instead, 4 members of the wait staff were giggling and carrying on at the corner of the bar.
They brought my mother a chicken enchiladas instead of cheese and then it took her 10 minutes to explain what the error was to the waiter and bus boy who then finally had to tell the manager who was also confused and my mother is fluent in Spanish.
They were seating people without reservations who were either friends of the employees or were slipping the hostess $20 to get seated without a reservation.
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from.
Also, the waiter wrongly described a wine I had inquired about causing the sommelier to have to make a trip to the table to offer an alternate recommendation.
i've been there for lunch - when the place is empty- and the waiter spent more time outside, soaking up the sun for himself, like he was a patron.
After leaving the traditional 15% tip, the waiter ran after us for half a block to confront.
Excellent Steaks, the attitude of the Servers could be a little better but the food makes up for everything.
the sushi is so-so, the 70s orange-themed atmosphere is 2000ish, and there is no reason for the staff's attitude.
The waitress told us the portions were not big, so we each got an entree and shared a side.
Even if you have to wait a bit for a reservation, the hostess will come over to apologize, update you on the wait and make sure you are comfortable.
very nice servers, but they seemed more interested in conversing with the regulars than bringing food and being attentive.
We were charged for the missing appetizer and when I complained to the manager, who never thought to apologize, he blamed the kitchen.
One of the waitstaff spilled a huge drink on the floor that splattered everyone nearby, no offering of apology was made or to foot the drycleaning bill and no comp was offered either.
Unfortunately for them, we would have ordered twice as many drinks if we didn't have to wait half an hour for the waitress between every drink.
Our waiter told us he knew all the wines on it quite well, and he did!
There were about 4 tables filled in the entire restaurant yet the hostess made us sit at the bar for 20 mins--she never would have come for us had we not approached her asked to be seated.
The kicker was when there were three items on our check that were priced higher than stated on the menu and by the server.
If you had good service there, try to get your waiter's name and request him/her by name the next time.
Our waiter was stuffed with attitude and didn't bother explaining things on the menu that he clearly knew we could not understand.
If you are a person who wants perfect service, you should probably skip it, you may wait for your server to sing a song before you get your drinks but that is half the fun.
When a seemly accommodating Le Souk manager assured you that he had no problem serving a group of twenty on a Saturday evening, I expected him to keep his words or shall I say our table.
dining with my mother this past Saturday must have signaled to the wait staff that I wasn't cool enough to merit their attention.
the staff knows the regulars by name and the sushi chef even yells goodbye from behind the bar.
FINALLY the waitress came with our food after an HOUR!
Before our server took our drink order she told us that the prices on the menu were going to be higher that night because of the party.
when tables opened up, the manager sat another party before us.
After arguing about this and requesting tap water instead of a bottled variety, we were exiled to customer Siberia, and the staff seemed eager get us out of the restaurant as soon as possible.
We were ignored by our waitress after our entrees had been served.
When I was there with a friend the waiter who served us was pretty friendly.
On top of that, when we tried to order more food half-way through our first entree order, the waitress told us that we couldn't because they needed the table for another reservation!
The busboy kept our glasses full; the waiter warmed up to our table at the end of the night by cracking jokes.
The place was packed and while our food took time to be prepared, our waiter earned points for his sparkling conversation to pass time and for also knowing practically every ingredient of every special under consideration.
The festive crew serves from a gigantic menu of American classics: chili, burgers, cobb salads, baked potatoes, wings, philly cheesesteaks, club sandwiches, you name it.
The clientel, however, make it a scene for creative, talented people--inlcuding a soon-to-be-famous theater director who used to waitress there!
I liked the overall setting A LOT and it was only improved by the fact that our waiter was pleasant and attentive even though we only ordered entrees (no drinks, no appetizers, no coffee).
first of all, the hostess was not pleasant and had a bit of an attitude when seating us.
The mussels and frits were great, but the host had an attitude and my friends and I waited about 1 1/2 hours to be seated on a random Tues.
My date knew the waiters from years of dining here, so we were treated like royalty.
Were told we could not share one menu and called over the horrible manager.
The owners couldn't have been more accomodating -- we had the entire restaurant to ourselves on a Saturday (before it opens to the public for dinner).
We would have left and gone to another restaurant but the host kept saying that a table was opening up in 5 minutes, people had just paid, etc - except when I went to check the table, they were ordering dessert.
Our waiter was pushing us all night to take our plates, and swiped my dessert before I was finised with it.
The waitress had an ongoing diatribe with a waiter the whole time she served us-it was ALL BAD!!
The service was rather slow but our waiter was very pleasant and obliging.
Didn't like having to flag down waiters for drinks, nor having to wait almost 15 minutes for a check after asking two servers.
A+ for the food but the wait staffs need to educate themselves better.
I also asked for a chef (thought that may be able to talk about the food for the party), but the waitress said that there was no chef at the restaurant.
Our waiter (who also seemed to be the manager) dropped red wine all over me the contents of my purse and all he did was apologize quickly, hand me some club soda and avoid me for the rest of the time I was there.
To be fair, I realize I was there for lunch and that the food is probbably better at dinner service when a full kitchen staff has arrived and prepped, but I doubt I'd return to find out with so many other options in the neighborhood i already trust.
There is NO waiting area - waiters, diners,and staff all converge in a tight space.
The chefs and staff are welcoming and happy to make substitutions or tune the spice up or down to your requests.
So I go into the bar, and I ask the (extremely hot) waitress, what's the soup of the day?
When the manager came to our table at the end of the meal and asked how our experience was, I complained to him about the cold.
both appetizer and main were poorly made by some random cooks the picked up from who knows where.
The inattentive waiters never refilled our water glasses, never offered more drinks, our silverware was never replaced, and it took almost half an hour at times for them to clear our table after we finished a course.
when the waitress finally took our order after being seated at the table for over 30 minutes only to wait another 45 minutes for food and when the food arrived the order was incomplete.
Lastly, the bartender didnt give me detailed bill, just my credit card receipt to sign.
In the hour we waited for our food we had to remind our mentally challenged waitress 3times to bring our chipssalsa.
We decided to order soup (over $6 a bowl), thinking that would be quick, however our waitress then said the soup is OUT OF A CAN and still would be a 20 minute wait since the tickets are processed in order.
Waitress didn't know anything about the menu, but other than that I would recommend.
the service was somewhat spotty, but we were rewarded with free drinks and the waiters were all sweet and lovely, genuinely french-speaking but not snooty!
The man working the door (red hair)-very funny and warming.
One of my friends told them it was my birthday and the staff relally surprised me when their came to me singing with the mexican hats and a dessert with a candle on it.
After sitting without any beverages for about fifteen minutes, the manager got up and poured a glass of water for his smacking companion.
PDiddy need a new staff you would have thought it was a bunch of old people cooking the food and waiting on us.
We ended up having appetizers in the lounge, while listening to a really great DJ.
Keep in mind, no one else was even in the restaurant and we were asking the waitress questions about entree options.
i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess.
The waitress was kind and helpfull with the menu.
The servers, casual in their striped button-downs, anticipate and fulfill needs as if they were trained as mind readers.
Fortunately the hostess was nice enough to take our appetizers off the bill after we complained.
It was not the mistake of the frozen lasagna, it was the icy service of the manager which has spoiled this restaurant for me.
The manager (or someone very important that was able to be seated 1/2 hour before opening) sat in the corner, with a glass of wine, a date, and talked on his cell for about an hour, loudly, while the first arrivals were sent to the hotel tearoom next door.
We had to ask for bread after 45 minutes and even though our waiter was GREAT, he had to ask the stiff manager to comp us a round of drinks for waiting so long.
These are all new items on the menu the waiter told us, and they were delicious!
On another occasion, this same gentleman brought bottled water for our entire party [4] on the house again, when we missed our cab and asked to wait inside.
The only thing whihc i (and my partner) never heard before was: the waitress mentioned the price of the specials (?
The waitress did try to get the manager to at least give us the Sangria on the house but the manager refused.
One friend's pizza arrived about 15 minutes before the rest of our meals (the remainder of our entrees did not even arrive at the same time), and our waiter half-heartedly apologized for the delay while rolling his eyes.
We asked for bread plates when the bread was brought to the table and the server's response was management has decided not to offer bread plates.
First, the waiter brought us to a table where people were still finishing their coffee from their meal - he told them the restaurant was busy and they needed to finish now and to pay their bill inside.
' When I called the waitress on it, she said that they simply couldn't serve tap water.
With all of the kitchen goof-ups (appetizer coming out before the entree and one entree coming out ten minutes before the other) you would think that the wait staff would have been more attentive.
Once seated, there was no waitress to give us our menus.
We initially ordered a bottle of wine and the waitress though we may not like it, so she offered us a taste.
The staff was accomodating towards our daughter and nice enough to check up on her after they served dinner (I was a little concerned about the spices and they suggested a dish).
She then sent over the owner, and his only recourse was to give us a free bottle of sparkling wine.
I was not allowed to transfer my credit card to the table, and was treated disgracefully while the hostess waited for the bar to sign off my card.
I don't remember the dessert item but when it was brought out flashing lights overhead threw colored beams on the walls and a young waiter came over to our table and did a little dance that was Bollywood MTV for the East Village set.
The fact that the resteraunt staff couldn't even keep a reservation straight, not to mention that after screwing up, they told us to go scratch and made us wait almost 2 hours.
One waitress was downright rude when we asked for the check.
A waiter looked me in the eye and said we did not order wine, as if to infer we were making this up.
I am not good with using chopsticks and asked for a fork, instead the owner insisted that I try using a chopstick an made me an easy-to-use chop stick right there on the spot!
Basic facts: sub-par limited menu; poorly made drinks; random crowd; and a waitress (although entertaining) that was doing shots behind the bar.
The store has a great atmosphere amd amazing staff who are always there to help if its a cup of coffee or a nice chat.
why go there to deal with staffs' attitude and eat bad food?
The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down, rushing you out.
When my group complained to our waiter about a cake cutting fee that involved no cutting, the manager came over to the table and basically told us that it was our fault for not knowing that their policy was just to serve the plates, not to cut.
Diners sit around large tables where chefs ostentatiously chop, slice, stir-fry and grill.
The menu was nothing special (I had to switch my entree choices several times because the server told me that the portion is really REALLY small!)
I had to wait quite a while to get my food and the waitress almost knocked me in the head with her tray.
I even had a waiter who was carrying a tray of beers actually TELL me to get out of the way as I was making my way towards the door.
Coffee served without sugar/milk and took more than 10 min to catch the waiter to ask for it.
The menu of upscale American fare is somewhat intimidating as there are almost too many choices, but our wonderful waiter Eric came to the rescue suggesting and describing specials as if he had just polished off dinner himself.
The waiter simply comped off our appetizer and then stayed away for the rest of the night--we waited an additional twenty minutes after we were done eating for the check!
I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name.
Otoro tuna, gorgeously marbled with fat, is captivating; hamachi sashimi, topped by the chef with a whisper of sea salt and a barely-there squeeze of lemon, creates eye-rolling pleasure.
It took about ten minutes to get out drink ordering after sitting down and once we recieved the bottle our waitress never once refilled our glasses!
Save the $$ and go to to curry hill (just 2-3 blocks away) or spend the $$ at a midtown indian eatery  (Also: I commented to hostess prior to seating that there were a lot of tables empty when choosing my seat, and she snapped back that they had a lot of reservations coming in at one time.
The waitress conveniently added in her tip into our bill, charged $10 for each margarita.
Waiters take your order and you don't get your food for at least 1 hour so you can prchase drinks.
waitstaff was more into pushing the sparkling water than give me a wine menu.
We ordered 1/2 bottle of Gruner, 2 appetizers - foie gras and oysters, 2 entrees - steak and diver scallops, and 1 dessert, the pastry chef's favorite a mixture of crushed avocado, salt glazed caramel and lime sorbet (which really tasted like margarita infused guacamole, to try only if you're feeling wd-50 adventurous) for around $100.
The waiter was very attentive and always kept the bread and drinks coming.
The drinkers beside us had fresh glasses of water brought on trays to replace the empties and a smiling waitress to cater to their every whim.
Never on the menu or in my inquiry to the waitress was the word garlic mentioned.
Also, be wary of what time of the day you go; around dinnertime, the restaurant becomes a jungle of diners and hustling waitresses.
I went there recently with my boyfriend and not only did it take the waitress 20 minutes to acknowledge we were even there, 20 minutes to get us water and coffee and even MORE time to place our order and get food!
We are 30 plus year olds, very gainfully employed, were not being loud or obnoxious, there were other diners around us as well as a bunch of people at the bar and nobody seemed to have a problem with us except for this manager.
The service was non-existant, the manager spent all of his time at the bar.
(So long that it prevented me from increasing their sales by getting more possible drinks) If i just saw my one waiter the whole night I would have known who to talk too.
And when a waiter, in answer to a question by a diner, turns to another table and asks excuse me, do you know what this is?
Out waitress never came back to our table after taking our food orders.
However, after speaking with the manager on the phone for about 15 minutes, the waitress said they couldn't give us any discount but would gladly give us a free pitcher of sangria.
Our waiter suggested a fantastic Greek wine that was far less expensive then we were willing to spend.
The food and the value had been ok on our meal, and then after only a little more than an hour, the check was slipped onto the table for our large party, and a few minutes later, waiters began yelling at us to leave.
When asked to explain the hostess told us she would lose money by seating us instead of them.
I asked one waitress if I could change tables and she didn't say no outright.
After we sat down and started ordering, the waiter informed us that they were really only into serving dinners.
) Howver, we didn't expect to be bumped by waiters a few times during our dinner.
After we finished our salad our waitress told us that they had run out of roast lamb and pastitichio.
Upon finishing our meal that same waitress that ignored us, suddenly appeared at our table asking if we needed our check, we were finishing our coffee and drinks, yet she was blatantly trying to get us out so that the table could be turned over.
waitress brought different food.
Bartender seemed cool, so maybe I'd go back for a drink.
Our waiter recommended thZt we share a few of the appetizers; they were great.
In all cases, service is slow but it's not the waiters fault.
Let me count the problems: music so loud it hurt, sticky unclean tables, the waitress took a long time to take our order, and then didn't bring a glass for the beer.
Music was blasting (speakers located practically on top of every table), and we asked the waitress if they can turn it down.
food is heaven  we were greeted by the hostess and sat down immediatly the space was very crowded and and we decided to order drinks promptly food can wait.
the wait staff looks like were doing us a favor giving us service and two loud guys at the bar made my evening with my wife quiet miserable.
The waitress encouraged to come for dinner and brunch, and I followed her recommandation.
i had the smallest martini, which the waiter spilled part of.
To sum it up, the steak is indeed the best out there, but the servers and especially the hosts are big time jerks.
For dinner we decided to take our servers advice and order several items to share.
The Scene Superfine is an easygoing, instantly appreciable neighborhood hangout that boasts a kitchen staff armed with serious cooking chops.
We waited for 1 hour each time the waitress came over to our table.
On my last visit we arrived around 9 on a Saturday, and although it wasn't crowded, the waitress acted like we were inconveniencing her, forgot bread, drinks, etc.
Our waiter snubbed us when we asked if there was dessert (there wasn't), and my meal would have been the same price had it not been restaurant week.
Actually she want to eat sushi, but their staff reject to serve it.
Tony's gone, sadly Ernie's passed on and now the waiters have corn rows and less finish to their chosen profession but it still maintains it's class and place as a brooklyn landmark.
The waitress took our menu away, without taking our food order!
We told the waitress a few more were coming and ordered drinks.
One time the waitress left in the middle of our dinner.
I dined at Belleville and my meal was distrupted by the manager yelling at the wait staff in the middle of the dining room.
Seated by a moody hostess and presented a menu that included live food-samples.
Our server didn't have the sommelier stop by when we were trying to decide on wines, he never brought the bread we requested and didn't crack a smile the whole evening until he saw that I was paying the tab when he suddenly became nicer.
At first I was shocked by the price, but the excellent and friendly service from our waiter Jack was great and the duck salad was the best ever.
At the end of the meal the manager stopped by and said dessert was on her.
Our server never bothered to inquire as to whether or not we wanted coffee.
The hostess finally seated us at a table for two when there were three of us in an empty restaurant.
I didn't even have time to finish my single cocktail and the waiter didn't even ask if we wanted coffee but instead, gave us our check without us even requesting it.
It was somewhere between our waiter not knowing what sushi came as part of the tasting platter and the copious amounts of wine that he spilt while trying to pour me a taste that I realized.
The owner and his sister make you feel like you've been invited over to their house for dinner.
we all liked the brunch items we had but when we later asked if the chips were supposed to come with the meal, the waitress explained it away by saying sometimes they forget instead of apologizing and offering something extra.
The next thing we know, the bartender comes over and says (and I quote verbatim), I already gave you two beers (which he hadn't).
The food is simply remarkable as is the fiery female master sommelier!
The waitress interrupted us halfway through our meal to say that if we wanted dessert we had to order it then, because the kitchen wanted to close.
The wait staff had good recommendations and when i broke a wine glass, they reacted in a way to put me out of my embarrassment quickly and even filled me a new glass of wine.
Waiter brought white instead of red wine.
one of us still had wine, so the others tried to order dessert drinks, but the owner told us no because there were people waiting and the waiter said if he served us more he would be fired.
We were hassled about seating by our waiter who seemed at the end of his pony-tail, so we opted for the bar, quaintly decorated with giant fly strips.
The waiter did not take a drink order from us.
hard to work a buzz with the server taking so long between every round, but worth trying the signature african rum cocktail and happily surprised they had our favorite white - sancerre by the glass at this japanese restaurant.
While we were trying to have dinner, all of the waiters spent their time playing with spilled milk at the counter, not paying any attention to the diners.
(they should if you are willing to spend $400 on dinner) if the owner of this restaurant saw how the staff was acting he would fire ALL of them.
One example, I ordered an appetizer that was not prepared as the menu stated and had to argue with waitress to get it fixed.
We ask the waiter where's the chocolate?
The bar had a hip DJ and the crowd was ultra chic.
The waiter never came by to check on us after the bus boy brought us our food.
The waitstaff is nice, but is pushy and seemed irritated when we did not order an a la carte side vegetable (we already had a cheese plate, appetizers and ordered 2 entrees).
Our waiter took our drink orders and never came back!
The new server we had was surprisingly well-versed on the menu and gave really solid service.
the solitary waitress was friendly though i found her service a little slow.
Our waiter didn't know the menu or the ingredients.
Later in the evening after our meal we finally found the real owner behind the bar of the restaurant and explained to him the situation which he had been made aware of by the waitress.
We politely asked our server for the regular menu, but were told that for large parties they could only offer us the banquet menu (would have gone elsewhere had we known).
The ambience is diner-like and the wait staff is rushed, but at these prices, I can't complain.
Then the menu is all in Italian well I don't speak Italian so it took forever for the waitress to translate.
It's really great to go in here and be able to get a creative cheap drink (they have things like blueberry mohitos for $4), a $4 plate of veggie spring rolls, and be able to joke with the bartender.
After waiting for 90 minutes, the host gave away our table to a couple who arrived after us.
I asked the waiter about the vintages of the wines, to which he replied, I don't know, probably 2003/2004.
We tried explaining nicely to them that we were just finishing up a drink, and after a brief, unprofessional discussion with the two waiters, they told us never to come back again.
The manager sent us a complimentary glass of wine for the steak not being cooked like he wanted.
I guess if you order the chef's tasting menu, which is a seven course meal with an optional wine matching for $125pp then your tummy will be well satisfied.
We weren't sure we'd even get a table,surprisingly the lovely hostess assured us she'd get us in if we gave her 15 minutes in the bar.
Perhaps it's early and they will improve but service is VERY slow - took a good 25min for waiter to take our order on both visits and the second time I was one of three tables at a 5:30pm reservation so not like it was busy.
was yelling at the rest of the waitstaff audibly enough that I was able to follow his entire tirade from where I sat in the secondary dining room.
The downside is that perhaps due to rice's eclectic nature, the chef has trouble cooking any single type to perfection.
As if the 2 hour wait wasn't bad enough, the host/manager was so busy flirting with attractive female customers, he didn't seem to notice we had been sitting at the bar and we ended up missing his call.
the kimchi and other sides were off, the rice had red bean mixed in, and the waitress gave us a double order of the bulgogi instead of two single orders of different meats.
After being seated took our waiter 10 mintues to get us a menu, 15 minutes to come back for our order, by the time we finally got our food it was almost 1 1/2 hour since getting there.
After waiting forty minutes for our brunch, learned that the waitress had -- oops!
the staff prefers to watch TV in the main dining room infront of their waiting customers then serve their customers.
), but our waiter was had a horrible attitude, couldn't remember to bring lemon for our water, or soy sauce for our sushi rolls, the food was wonderful, but unfortunately the service ruined our visit.
Finally, the manager had the audacity to lock the doors, presumably to prevent us from skipping out on the bill, while one of our friends went to an ATM to get cash.
And for families they have high chairs and waiters were really nice to my kid.
Then, we discovered that not ordering guacamole for your table is tantamount to asking the wait staff to roll their eyes at you and then ignore you during your entire meal (I had to eventually go to the front of the restaurant to ask for our check).
Their main chef Louie, makes the oddest specials you will ever see and the portions are quite large.
The wait staff were incredibly attentive, though as a warning, if you like wine, but also a little privacy, this might not be a good idea, since they have the tendency to hover a bit.
The waiter brought us the desert menu, and when we refused asked if we were really sure we didn't want anything.
The service was average - the waiter did not check in on our meals and did not even refill the water, but was a bit pushy on desert (we both ordered schnapps).
When we confronted the hostess, she told us that there were 3 of them and only 2 of us, and that the 3 women had a reservation at 8:30pm.
I tried the price fix and te waiter looked offended when I requested the price fix menu.
The waitress was not very responsive to requests and was slow to return with drinks.
The staff is cool and friendly, and the place has been around since J.
One of the managers offered us a seat at the bar to wait for a table, there we had the most amazing empanadas and red sangria.
The waiter ignored us for ten minutes, the restaurant was empty, got our drink orders wrong, got one main dish order wrong and the disappeared for another ten minutes before we could get the check.
We tried to place the order and the waiter had no clue what we wanted even though we pointed it out on the menu.
The restaurant didn't mind me sitting on their doorstep to the extent that the bartender invited me in for a drink.
That said, I made sure to pay before we had coffee, so that the server was not waiting on us to pay; and I left a 30% tip, knowing we'd be there for a while.
When the hostess finally appears she tells me that she can't seat us on the mostly empty patio because all the open tables are for dinner not drinks.
The space and furnishings are too spartan and the service amateur and scattershot (no smiles offered here - busboy serves mains with who gets the.
Apparently, the waitress informed us that they change the menu at 5 Ninth every few days, which kind of explains the hit or miss situation.
had dinner there last night, max the waiter was great.
I was really excited when our waiter read off the list of specials.
Last night the dining room was crammed and seemingly only had one waiter which is ludicrous.
A bright spot: the server was immeadiately apologetic and whisked problem plates away, and replacements were prompt.
Management had always been rude, but without the great staff as a buffer, Jesse's is just another pubby place with poor decor and average food.
We were a large party, over 6 people, and after our initial drinks, which included a couple bottles of wine, and order were taken we did not see a waiter or a busboy again for over an hour!!
We approached the host and manager politely after the meal but only received a simple and insincere Sorry.
We were left waiting a while after our food for our waiter to return, and thus we did not have time for dessert.
The server seemed drunk, he forgot mixed up our food with some other table, ignored our requests for more water, drinks etc.
The service is good, but the staff is not too friendly.
The wait was not very long and the staff was great.
Our waiter, even though he was serving dinner, was SO out to lunch.
If the staff actually got it together and showed some customer service this place would be good.
I let the waiter know and he offered me a free dessert.
Customers choose flavors like sweet cream, cake batter or banana, add mix-ins--ranging from candy bar chunks and Gummi bears to hot fudge and peanut butter--then servers mash it all together on a frozen slab of granite.
Our server spilled a drink on the table cloth and it was cleaned up in an instant, no mess, free drinks to compensate, and left us impressed at how seamlessly this was fixed.
I agree with the many posters addressing an oppressively aggressive waitstaff, and I'm in particular support of the review directed at Franny's bizarrely adamant refusal to cut pizza (or provide adaquate knives/plates for us to do it ourselves).
finally they wanted to take our app order before taking our wine order, seemed like the waiter couldnt handle it all at once.
They may love the wacky/tacky decore, the overly gracious host, Gus, and his staff, the loads of freebies (oranges, cookies, lollies and wet naps), but the food is just mediocre.
5 minutes later the same waitress came back to have us move to the next table so she could seat a party of 4.
the waitress was not attentive at all and we had to keep getting the attention of the water servers to get more drinks.
Waitstaff is preoccupied dancing on the bar and googling at beautiful people, but who can blame them.
My Moon spent all their money on an architect/interior designer and forgot about the chef.
I asked one of the more elderly managers what we were eating and he joked that he didn't really know so he referred someone else to us who basically repeated what was written in the menu.
Meanwhile, our server was dancing and posing by the bar.
The whole table must participate and you have to be willing to let the chef cook for you with no menu.
When we went up to get what we assumed would be our second drink at no charge, the bartender charged us $5 a piece.
We saw problems with our waitress immediately when she frowned when we opted for tap water instead of bottled.
Waiter was very arrogant, though tha staff was attentive and when a waiter pilled a glass of water on one of our guests, the hostess ran with a dry cleaning voucher even though we did not make a big deak of it - just an accident and only water.
When I asked the manager to remove the coffee, she did so without question, but never asked why and never followed up on the issue (she was far too busy flirting with the male waiters).
We both orderd drinks that we never recived, but were charged for, and when we said something to the waiter he rolled his eyes and asked if we wanted them anyway (after we were done eating and more than ready to go.
waiters were very nice, they dont take reservations during the week end, we waited at the bar with some sangria, Very good experience, loud music but we were able to communicate easily, overall i recommand this place to groups and dates,   Will be back more often!
I discovered recent new management has made major improvements at this location ie the bar, dining areas, party room and bathrooms and keeping the kitchen open after 11PM.
I would not suggest dining here unless you get a different server.
I will say that often times they make their drinks very strong (may tell your bartender / waitress to keep it mild).
The server spilled beer on the table when he poured it; he dropped ice cubes for another one of our guests and water everywhere else.
The only downside was the service was slow and our waitress kept forgetting to bring our drinks.
The waitstaff is charming and knowledgeable about the menu.
We got up from the bar and got pushy with the hostess and finally were seated at an excellent table.
Our hostess was more concerned about the appearance of the banquets than wether we had the right menus.
The second time we went the waiter didn't put in our pizza order!
The ensuing dinner was definitely worth the wait; I'll be dreaming about chef Jodi Williams' extraordinary fried squash blossoms for a long time.
Beers on tap were pretty good and we had a great waiter but the food left much to be desired.
But the service, though invariably genial and helpful, can be weirdly haphazard -- waiters disappear mysteriously, only to reemerge just when you've decided their shift must have ended -- possibly an understaffing issue?
on the food-front while adding just enough of a civilized atmosphere where you won't worry about either your neighbor or the wait staff biting off one of your fingers.
Arrive at 7:00pm, the waiters didn't give us our menus till an 1 1/2 hour later.
The waitstaff was helpful but watch out, after you pay your hefty bill managment will ask you to leave if they think you've lingered too long.
my one complaint is that when we were finished with our dinner, it took an abnormally long time for our waitress to get with the program and bring us our check.
My friend was a vegetarian and the staff went out of their way to provide her with a special entree.
If you go in, make sure to listen to the unbelievably loud microphone that the folks at the counter use to dictate orders to the cooks who stand about two feet behind them.
Unfortunately, that lunch can take a loooooong time as the waiters seem to forget food orders, forget drink orders, and forget to refill water glasses.
Ordered a beer from the bartender, she opened it and the told me that she didn't know the price !!
Personally, I like my food fresh, so you just have to tell the waiter that you would like to order by ear.
My partner had ordered an appetizer that was no longer available; the waitress did not inform us when reviewing the specials.
The complete and total rudeness and frustration surrounding this place started with the hostess calling us in the middle of the afternoon asking if we could change our reservation.
Our waiter must have been a 'stand-in' because he did not know the menu, choices or basic service protocol (bread plate on the left).
If your friends persuade you to check this place out, I suggest that you order all of your drinks, apps, entrees, desserts, and the check up front, because you'll never see your server again.
The waiter knew about every item on the menu and explained it very well.
The waitress only stopped at our table to take our order and pick up the check.
While the server offered nothing, the host apologized, and said that he hoped that I would return again, perhaps for brunch.
I noticed many of the other comments had negative things to say about the service and food - my thoughts and suggestions are: eat at the bar to avoid a rude waiter or bad service here and Artisanal's reputation is based on the cheese, get the CHEESE and not the steak or whatever.
Our waitress was very nice, not snotty - she even gave us a free apertif after the meal (and left the bottle on the table).
The waiter, of course had no knowledge of the yet to be produced wine list and no wine steward or manager bothered to come by the table to check in.
What I liked the most is that the staff listened attentively to what I asked for and my meal was prepared EXACTLY the way I asked, what a treat.
Although we had to wait a long while and the hostess was very busy behind the bar, she was very apologetic and sincere which made it feel ok to have to wait.
The wait staff is very attentive, and you can smoke at the bar while enjoying the view of the river.
-the bread served was cold  -the choices for restaurant week was very slim (no meat dish except pork) -there were no chef's treats or delights -the food was ok but not up to the quality expected There are more exciting, romantic restaurants in the city to visit.
Our waiter showed up two minutes later to take our order and showed up with our drinks 25 minutes later and they were not crowed.
Went to Public last Saturday, couldn't get a table so the lovely host suggested that my partner and I dine at the bar.
The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal.
When after 2 hours we did ask for our entrees, the waiter and busboy were both extremely rude.
The waitress came three times: to take our order, to bring the order, and to bring the check.
The small bar is always packed with people, and you have to constantly contend with waiters asking you to move as they navigate through the crowd to make it to their tables.
Although the waitress had clearly our reservation on her book, she told us somebody arrived one minute ago and being first to arrive, he could have our table.
Starting off with an excellent carafe of Cotes du rhone suggested by the waiter, we soon ordered a few appetizers like the steak tartare, the escargot and the goat cheese tart.
Although there were many open tables, the manager insisted my party wait at the bar for over one hour.
We tried the Tasting menu', and the manager offered to select the items to be served after taking inputs from us ( Choice of meat, allergies etc.
After they were done poking and prodding our food, the waiter took it right from their table and tried to give it to us.
I have worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years, and so am understanding of things out of my server's control, and I have never experienced such poor service!
The hostess failed to inform us of that the restuarnt was hosting a private company party when we made the reservation.
We waited forever for our orders, our drinks came out AFTER our food, we never got refills on water, we had to ask like three times for extra dressing, and our waiter was rude.
We asked the chef if it was possible to have two different tasting menus, to which he was quick and eager to comply.
The service was very rushed and as we were finishing our drinks and paying our bill, the owner asked us to leave so he could seat other people at our table.
Our waiter was great and we even got drinks and some food courtesy of the cheff- maybe because it wasn't so busy when we went.
The manager very politely told the drunk man that he could leave and then gave everyone on the resturaunt a free glass of port for having to witness it.
Oh, you should have seen the look on the waiter's face when we told him we didn't want any coffee after the meal.
We felt the waiter and captain rushed us through our meal.
Servers are layed back, but food arrives rapidly.
I went there for lunch a couple of times but whenever I went there (even though we pinpointed our order on menu), waitress messed up our order and they never said sorry.
We had a very nice and entertaining waitress who was very much on top of our table.
We sat soaked in red wine for 20 minutes eating our meals w/o the wine b/c the server saw us like that but did nothing until we stopped him.
Went with a large group of 7 ladies before a show, and the staff was extremely obliging, even when one person was late and we had to wrap up her dinner to take to her.
A cocky, arrogant and shockingly condescending manager (all of 22 years-old) then told us we should leave the restaurant if we wouldn't move to the bar.
Then the huffy hostess when we asked to be seated at a table not directly on-top of another couple.
Our waitress left halfway through dinner, without explanation, and was replaced by another waiter.
Not including the tip for our server, who we saw twice in an hour?
Reservations are no guarantee of prompt seating, have a pre-game drink, pop a xanax and you can handle the drama of having a res and getting no love from the hostess.
The snooty manager asked us to leave and gave us our check in the middle of our meal.
Service was prompt, although at times the waiters seemed to be spending more time dealing with the overflow from the bar than the diners (ever heard of cocktail waiters).
My companion went to the bathroom and overheard the waiter singing near the back of the place The cappuccino machine is broken, It's broken.
after such a strong showing, dessert was a letdown per our waiters recommendation, we ordered the raspberry softie the coconut-stuffed apricots the softie tasted like a mixture between cough syrup a starburst, whereas the apricots were extremely sour.
Asked for wine recommendations and the waitress told me her favorites and described them in detail - I don't encounter this much in NYC.
Just expect to wait a good twenty minutes before they take your order (even when the restaurant is half empty), you'll have to ask at least 5 waiters and a manager for coffee before they bring it to you and when they bring your orders out wrong, expect the manager to side with the chef and not you.
We were not seated by a hostess (and as a result didn't receive menus or water for a good while) and were rushed out as the restaurant closed an hour after we arrived.
Seconds after we permitted our half-eaten fattened goose livers to be whisked away, our waitress materialized, bearing two cold drinks and the chef's profound apologies for the dish - a completely unneccessary but vastly appreciated gesture.
When one of our party brazenly asked to substitue a flavor of gelato for one of the desserts on the menu, the waiter snobbishly told us that, Mario and the chef don't like to do that.
Remember the 80's when you have to wait 1-2 hours for a table even though you have a reservation + the wait staff treated you like the idiot that you are for paying $2-300 per head for this treatment, then you should definately come to experience this jewel!!
A good restaurant would have at least comped desert or sent over a round of drinks for such a long wait -- we didn't even get an apology from a manager.
The Scene Behind the often-fogged windows at this small restaurant is a homey atmosphere, full of smiling employees and Filipino families crowded around simple red tables.
The staff was knowledgeable about the cuisine and answered my dining questions with professionalism and style.
We recently went for dinner with two kids and the staff were very accomodating even without reservations.
The waiter was constantly puching us to have drinks, he told us that we were not ordering properly and insisted on bringing to the table his recommendations.
Avoid this restaurant on a busy night at all costs -- they have yet to learn how to make the appropriate number of reservations; the front of the house and the managers are amateurs.
When we finally had to see the manager because I had lemon juice spilled on me from the waiter- she even took over 10 minutes to come to the table.
However, another server kept hovering over our table, wanting to take our half-finished plates away.
When questioning our server about a certain dish, she kindly brought over the Union Sq.
Bar has, french fries, bunch of different vegs and fruits, sushi, ribs (not great, wait for the waiters that come around with the meat).
The waiter seemed astounded that I ordered no wine or alcohol -- just water -- with my meal.
Those who choose an omakase (chef's choice) menu will be happily surprised with accents of jalapeno or swaths of homemade sauce cleverly accenting rolls and sushi alike.
As for the food, apart from the Chef's Omakase, the appetizers and rolls are just below mediocre for the price they charged.
When the ice cream cake I ordered didnt hold up in their regular freezers temperature, Giovanny immediately had a server run out and got an identical cake in 15 minutes.
At one point, I spilled my water glass--when I informed the waiter of this he said he would clean it up--he never got around to it.
Ok, it's not greasy steak and juicy burger good, but it's a light healthy fare, if you are into that kind of stuff.
The food had a somewhat elevated price tag but but fair considering the Nobu origin - The cocktails highly recommended including the spide and lobster roll - we were well plated and did not encounter any arragance from the staff - maybe the other student reviewers are used to cafeteria service.
After being seated outside by the host, a waitress came over and yelled at us for taking a table that belonged to people waiting at the bar.
We were able to get a table right away on Friday night, but we only saw our server twice and he failed to give us the specials, we overheard him tell the table right next to us after we had ordered and were already into our salads.
Unfortunately, as we were finishing up, the manager hovered around us and asked us to go to the bar to finish our drinks because there were other people waiting.
The last time I went to the restaurant, the waitress made me wait to take my order, then left me without anything to drink throughout the entire meal.
Our waitress asked us if we wanted anything else, we said only the check - she quickly scooped up our not-yet finished food.
The upside of Zen Palate is the open kitchen, which allows you to watch the cooks at work and removes fears of who only knows what the chefs are doing in the back.
Waiters had to reach over people to deliver food.
It took the waiter over 30 minutes to get our food because the order was misplaced.
(The booths remained unoccupied throughout our meal, unless you count the not-very-busy waitstaff.
Our server seemed to be new because he continually had to go back to the kitchen to check on menu items.
I finally cancelled our order, the waiter came back in 5 min with our plates.
I ordered the strip steak medium - the waiter or the chef reversed our requests.
The owner himself one time came to our table to clear our dishes when our waiter didn't show (a rare occurance, but it was late at night).
I went back a different night, once again I can't remember which, probably Friday and the place was a ghost town, with a corny DJ and a waitress who couldn't get my friend's drink right after several tries.
When asked to compare between two dishes, the server said whatever you like.
Apparently the same hostess was also trying to kick out a group of women having drinks at a table and giving them a hard time for holding up a table.
One of our diners didn't like her fish and both the waitress and the manager insisted on replacing it.
My friend and I were the ONLY 2 people in the entire place seated for dinner and after sitting there for 15 minutes, I had to walk over to our surly waiter and ask for menus.
Don't miss the crema catalana the waiter recommended us for dessert.
The hostess told me she could accomodate my group without a reservation but we ended up waiting nearly an hour and were seated in the smallest cramped area.
Thought I didn't have reservations, the hostess politely informed me that it would be a 45 minute wait and we were actually seated in 40.
the staff is great, but the food is just ok.
The staff is very friendly too~  Everything is wonderful about this place except for the bathroom.
To make matters worse an hour into our dinner we see a waiter take mojitos to another table.
Bringing a large group on a busy Saturday night ,I was afraid quality of food and service might not be up to par, but we were seated promptly and the service by our waitress was fantastic considering how busy it was.
Fifteen minutes later, when we asked about our drinks, another server went to investigate and found that they'd run out of one of the liqueurs they needed and had gone out to get more -- which is fine, but it would've been nice to know.
It's very cheap, food is great you can bring your own bottle of wine (saves sooo much money) The waiters will uncork it bring you glasses too !
Our lovely waiter sent us off with scones for breakfast the following AM!
Our waiter took his sweet time bringing the menus and telling us the specials and it wasn't until almost 10:15 that we put our order in.
I would have told the wait staff if anyone had asked me if I enjoyed my meal, but no one asked.
Upstairs they have an entirely separate hostess, as if it was a different restaurant all together, where after being asked once again if we had a reservation we were seated in a small seat, in the corner, of a practically empty room.
With only 2 tables occupied in the whole place, the waitress spent her time behind the bar and only came to help us when we got up and asked her to.
As we attempted to digest our meal and browse the dessert menu, the same staff members approached us to move along our order.
They moved us upstairs to an area where they were setting up for a private party -- we had no server, and had to flag down people setting up for the party to get us drinks, silverware, water, etc.
When we received the bill, we asked the manager to do something about the drinks, considering how poor the service was and her reply was, Well, you got them!
Our apetizers took quite a while to be served, in fact, while all the other tables that sat way after us were being served I asked the waiter what happened to our appetizers, the calamari was tough; The entrees were tasteless and really!, one have to be really bad to mess a simple pasta dish.
We had reservations, and so did the strangers, and yet the management claimed the other tables were reserved.
When I asked the waitress she told me it was because I ordered pancakes.
Service was atrocious: appetizers came out 3 minutes after we ordered, and 10 minutes before we finally tracked down the bottle of wine we had ordered, the waiter rushed us from start to finish, we had to repeatedly track down someone to pour us more wine since it wasn't at the table, etc, etc.
The white tablecloths covering closely-packed, old wood tables; waitresses with accents and up-turned noses; warm firelight ambience; boisterous crowds drinking wine -- it's all here.
Though the service leaves a lot to be desired, and the waitstaff runs around like chickens without heads, the beer is cold, the sake is hot, and the sushi is out of this world!
When the group arrived for the Noon lunch the restaurant was only partially set up and the group was forced to eat lunch while the staff noisily set up the restaurant around them.
The waiters can shoot off a 5 minute long list of specials, and they know the menu very well.
Our waiter said 3 words to us, wisked away our food as we were finishing, and the maitre'd could not take his eyes off our table waiting for us to leave.
The only downside was our waitress -- she forgot to order one of our side dishes, was not attentive, and then gave us our check before we finished our bottle of wine.
I spent more time looking for a waiter than I did enjoying my meal.
After sitting at the table with empty glasses for a 1/2 hour, we had to ask the busboys to get us drinks as our waiter was nowhere to be found.
The only thing that was a little annoying was that the hostess didnt want to let us finish our first drinks at the bar and kept rushing us to sit down.
We heard two different servers telling tables about these specials, and when we asked to hear them, they wouldn't tell us them.
The menu looked good, except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside.
The waiter, and someone at the next table, were both correct when they said that the lobster was delicious, but I though the price was a little steep.
The wait staff is very attentive; though if the place is really packed, then you may have to flag someone.
I asked the waiter to move us to another table because we didn't want to rush our meal.
Like the other Bromberg Brothers establishments, expect the customer is always wrong attitude from the staff along with overpriced wines you never heard of, no bar, tiny waiting area and lousy desserts.
The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.
The servers and/or bus persons dart back and forth through the dining room, never even making eye contact to see if you have any needs.
We ordered coffee, and then he ordered a bacon cheeseburger (for $12, ridiculous even for New York) The waiter then announced he was going to charge us a $4 sharing charge.
Despite talking to the weekday manager on the prior Monday, who gave me a hard time but agreed to make a reservation for me since my group was so big.
As we were finishing our dessert, a nearby waitress dropped a tray and HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE splattered all over my neck, hair and sweater and my boyfriend's clothes.
The manager refused to talk to me sending the waiter to tell me to tell me that he was not available, when I had previously seen him doing absolutely nothing at the bar.
The menu consists of a tasting selection, Austrian, traditional American, and the chef's recommended menu.
And forget about having a drink at the bar to take the edge off because the space between tables is so narrow that you'll be shoved by the wait staff who are desparate to get their job done.
(The band is positioned in front of the windows, in a space roughly the size of a living room.
It's the New York you thought was long gone; orders are spoken, not yelled, and the staff knows the names of patrons' dogs.
I told the waiter that my drink tasted very bad and asked if he could swap it out for a Petron Margarita.
The waiters, all wearing black suits, are serious, courteous, and knowledgeable; the dining rooms are ornate and convivial, with large parties celebrating various things interspersed with dressed-up couples on dates.
We didn't see him the rest of the night, the other courses come out sporadically, and no one ever asked if we wanted more wine (which we did) or refilled our water -- even after we flagged down another waiter, nothing happened.
After demanding a free round of drinks from a third manager, our party decided to bail on this horrific french import.
Our dinner was enhanced by a 1999 Pinot Grigio, recmmended by the waitress.
The waitress even gave us a complimentary dessert- warm chocolate lava cake with a scoop of cinnamon ice cream, what a perfect end to a perfect dinner!
After the rude waitress took our order we were sipping our drinks when the manager comes over and says we have to leave as the tables are reserved for dinner patrons.
We were promptly seated - the waitress was very attentive, got us drinks and menus.
The staff was courteous and explained the menu with detail.
We too had reservations but the gentleman never checked a book to see our names or check us off.
The host was aloof; my waitress, though sweet, didn't seem to know the food or the menu very well; and the waiter we flagged over to order our wine seemed as if he had never looked at the wine list before.
The waiter knew his menu and what to recommend.
The manager never came to our table and the restaurant didn't offer anything to compensate for the error (they could have taken the two cocktails off the check ).
The waiter did not know the menu, and was very unaccomidating about substutions.
With so many $20 bottles of wines from which to choose, our waiter helped pick a good one.
Relaxed neighborhooders treat the spot like a second home, calling the staff by name and lingering despite the smallish bar and hurried courses.
The Wasa Waffle was different but when we spoke to the manager he inmediatly changed if for another dish (He suggested the Chocolate decadence French Toast.
The owner lied to me when i asked where our food was 1 hour after we placed the order - he said oh your friend said you were not ready for it.
Now, I expressed my surprise and then the bartender and manager chimed in with a simpleton's remark sir, with restaurants at this time, reservations start coming in.
Never heard anything about a minimum required food order of $30 or had any bad experiences with the staff.
we saw another waitress spill hot coffee on another diner's foot.
Our waiter took his time taking our drink orders ('97 Italian red was good).
we wanted to join another 2 top table to ours and the manager abruptly said, that won't work for us!
I've heard all the complaints about food and staff at this place, and perhaps some people have had an unfortunate encounter with the host or a cranky waiter.
I waited for 45 minutes for my entree to realize that the waiter never put the order in.
The sign outside said, 26 beers on tap, however the bartender was unable to pull a pint from any of them.
no need for reservation) you'd expect the crew to be alittle more attentive.
At one point I noticed the grime on the mustard bottle and asked the waitress for a clean one.
Superfine is my preferred destination in the city when I'm looking for a casual, hip atmosphere, extraordinary food at decent prices and/or just a place to get a good drink, chat with the bartender and shoot some (free) pool.
our appetizers came out relatively quickly, but it was near impossible to get a hold of a waiter to order and get our drinks.
The food is average, however the service is way below average (our waiter was a stuttering fool when it came to the specials and left our drinks empty for the majority of the night) The atmostphere is cheesy as well as the crowd.
The manager came out very defensively and insisted that it was a 2 lb lobster.
The host's explanation was they could not control when people finish dinner.
The bartender has a nasty attitude, and it took a party of two 1 1/2 hours to get seated while party after party of the hosts 'friends' were given seating immediately.
Our salads and appetizers were brought at the same time and we barely had time to enjoy them before a team of waiters whisked them (and our bread!)
Our booth style seats would've been more romantic if our waitress, though nice, was less intrusive, and the loud music from its bar didn't filter thru so much.
My grandmother-in-law had a problem with her meal, and the manager AND chef came over and offered to replace it and/or take it off the check.
From making the reservation (not required) to the before dinner drink (cava), to the table (romantic), to the the ambiance (candles, spanish antiques, etc) to the food of course (original, incredibly deep and rich in flavor) to our departure and saying goodnight to the waiter.
After our waitress brought us menus took our drink orders, a diff hostess came over asked us to give up our table.
The waitstaff told us that they had already run out of one of the entrees (before 8 p.
(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.
The waitstaff chatted at the bar amongst themselves and completely ignored us for the entire meal-- which took some work, as the place is small enough with the garden closed!
There are a few chefs who aren't very enthusiastic and not very theatrical, but the end product is always great food.
The waitress, host, and bus staff were sitting around at the bar while the patrons were all complaining about the service.
The menu options were not appealing, we had to beg the waiter to ask the chef if we could have just a plain dinner salad to start as their salad choices were not appetizing.
The food and wine selection is superb and the chef brings it all together each and every time.
But even on New Years, when they were busy, the owners took the time out to visit our table frequently, even pouring us drinks herself from her own creations.
However the manager came over and aplogized and all drinks were on him.
The service was horrendous, not only did the waiter take an hour to remember we ordered drinks, we were rushed to eat and get out so they could seat the next party.
A friendly staff works the room, delivering favorites like crisp, crackling spring rolls and shredded pork rolls wrapped in rice paper.
The hostess did offer free drinks to my party due to the wait, but we were more interested in eating after said long wait.
We sat way before 2 other tables ahead of us that rec'd their appetizers before us; the waiter neglected to apologize.
I also watched several other frustrated customers getting the wrong orders or trying to catch the waiter's attention (he was posing at the soda fountain).
Our waiter ask us what kind of soufle we wanted and told us to get 2, making us believe that it was part of the pre-fixe, nope soufles are seperate and we were so full from dinner we could barely finish one.
The manager then comes over to the table and asks us to leave - to help him out because there were people waiting!
After our initial order, the waitress wasn't very attentive (we had to wait 15 minutes at a time to get her attention to refill drinks, order desert, etc).
The first time my husband and I went there, both the appetizer and entreee I ordered were not available, but we had a waitress who was really on top of things.
The staff treated them like true royalty.
Great when the band is playing, not so great when there's a large party at the bar.
The hamburger showed up long before the mussels, and the waiter suggested I start eating because he didnt want my food to get cold.
B/c the dinner focused on good friends and good food, not waiting around for service or being bothered by rude staff to leave.
Our waiter was not attentive, we waited about 20 mins just to order drinks.
This was not the same hostess I usually see there who happens to be very sweet and provides excellent service.
the service is so-so; our waiter told us there was a table for us, then took us back to the entrance , we then waited another fifteen minutes- confusion seems to reign.
Especially the manager or host who kept walking by and giving us the evil eye to see the progress of our dinner so they could turn the table over to other customers.
we told our waiter to make five selections for each of us, and he decided instead to charge us for each glass separately instead ($80 instead of $20).
OUr waiter was a little confused about how to serve champagne.
I also do not think waiters there are rude- yes there are not friendly and chatty, but do provide great service.
When I requested a specific beer on the menu, the waiter said they were all out of that one and kept pushing the only available beer, which I didn't want.
i went on a thursday evening and the restaurant was pretty empty the server got our drinks wrong 3 times!
The bigger sin is the service --our waiter was late with our main dishes, late with the bill, which was totaled incorrectly (twice).
the manager said that they were just starting with a preview menu.
A huge Coca-Cola sign dominates the bar, and cute waiters whisk plates of 'cue across the dining room and to the sidewalk patio.
I have never been treated more rudely than I was by the hostess and the manager of Public for brunch last Sunday; the hostess was arrogant, despicable, and mean to our party (reminder: she is a hostess in the service industry).
Hostess continued to ask us if everything was okay, and then did nothing when we gave her specific actions (how about some water or coffee served in paper cups).
The staff didn't even tell us (college kids) about the prix-fixe special, but the pair of older adults sitting next to us took advantage.
Place was empty, waitress was rude, told us that even though there were drink specials at the bar (2 for 1 margaritas), we couldn't have them at our table and we couldn't go up to the bar to get drinks.
After being treated like we were at Nobu by the hostess, our waitress brought us our check before we even asked for it and denied us a 2nd round of drinks because.
However, our one and only complaint was when I received my drink I gave my coupon to our waiter, he returned minutes later to tell me that it could not be used in the dining room, only at the lounge or at the bar.
Even when the place has been packed with tables (I saw a party of 12 in there last time), the waiters and bartenders are still nice.
Long wait for our meal (approx 30 minutes), unusual slow service, waitresses (especially the preety one with black hair) louder thn clients, do not care much for customers.
the hostess is rude as can be, the waiters can't stop to check in, the busboys are flinging stuff on your table, and that's true even when the restaurant is half empty!
Additionally, one of the waiters found it necessary to walk around the restaurant, telling people how to eat their food.
Lastly the waiters and bartender should learn to have argurments in private and not in front of customers.
I won't even wait for an hour and a half when I don't have reservations, but the hostess and the pompous maitre d' just jerked me around and kept on promising me that I'd be the next to be seated.
at the end of the meal the hostess came to us and rudely ask us to leave the table, we were astonished by her attitude.
our waiter spilled an entire glass of water on my brother and didn't so much as acknowledge it, let alone apologize.
The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.
Instead, the chef made me a special creation off the menu, and wow.
I followed my handsome waiter's suggestions for everything from my cranapple martini, BBQ duck tostada appetizer and rum-glazed pork tenerloin entree to the scandalously good brownie sundae.
As expected, the wine list is as thoughtful as the menu the staff has earned my trust with their bullet-proof recommendations I have yet to be disappointed from their exhaustive list.
Much to my satisfaction, I was seated promptly without a reservation and soon after being seated was greeted by my server.
before we could say anything, one waiter picked it up while another brought a knife to our table on a platter.
There was no price on the menu and the waitress recommended it.
The food is just ok, not at all worth having to put up with the disgusting staff, the manager/owner in particular.
Our waiter never once asked how everything was, as I suspect he knew the kitchen was producing seriously average food.
We were crammed next to the people who were seated to the right of us, who repeatedly took phone calls during dinner, while the rude wait staff did nothing despite the warning on the menu that cell phones were not to be used in the dining room.
Although we had to wait a few minutes for our table, the manager bought us a round of drinks and proceeded to take care of throughout the entire meal.
we walked in to the resturant, squeezed by our (to be) waiter (who ignored us and didnt step to the side), and straight up to the host (he was busy talking to the bar tender).
My wife and I invited our friends to a late dinner and were having drinks afterwards when the manager instructed the waitress not to serve us any more drinks as it was bottle service.
I am not sure if this was just an off night or what, our waiter forgot wine, brought us desert menus before dinner came, then brought us the wrong dinner.
We asked for the manager who told us that it was their first time serving brunch, to be patient and that our bill would be discounted.
The rude and unaccomodating hostess (who we later learned was the manager) repeatedly promised us the next table but never offered to buy us a drink while we waited.
Everyone around me was eating stuff that wasn't on the menu and looked tastier, but the waitress didn't bother to suggest any of these things, even when asked for suggestions.
The waiter asked us several times after dinner whether we had paid our bill yet, and after we had, he came over to make sure that we hadn't just hidden it from him or something.
After asking the waiter for a few minutes to look over the menu, we had to call out several times over 15 minutes to get him to come back to our table.
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix: Appetizers were ok, waiter gave me poor suggestion.
After spending about 2 hours in the restaurant our waiter decided to call it a night without even asking if we wanted dessert.
Not only did we have to flag the waiter down every time for every course or request, but they spilled our drinks twice all over the table - and once was hot tea.
We arrived about 15 minutes late for a Friday 12:30 reservation, but the staff couldn't have been nicer.
After dinner I walked over to the cheese counter -after having been greeted by a rude server, I was shocked to see how dissapointing their cheese selection was: it is miniscule, many of the fresh chevre cheese were more than ready to be tossed, etc.
The waitresses are at your table filling your water or oil before your last sip or dip.
It took us 20 minutes to get a check, despite many attempts at meaningful eye contact with the wait staff.
Our waiter disappeared entirely, our food, when we were finally able to order it, arrived without plates (we had to go and track down a busboy to get them), and when we were finished, we couldn't get the check, even after walking across the restaurant to request it.
The food was good but our waiters were pushy,rude and dumb.
We did complain to the manager, but she just said there are problems in the kitchen and took the drinks off bill.
I tried that on a Friday, told the guy otside the door that I did not have a reservation and he said, You may as well just leave now.
The hostess made sure we knew where the lounge was since all the seats at the bar were full and had the waiter come over to take our drink order.
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
Our waiter was ever so helpful as he stood back and watched my sister and I physically move our table.
Having heard that the steakhouse had a tendency to overcook the steaks, I asked the waitress that she ask the chef to prepare it closer to rare than medium.
After waiting more than 15 minutes for our order to be taken and then having the waitress not know how to make certain drinks, our party of 7 was obviously dissatisified.
the manager was nice profecional and service was average but the food was not italian, a diner is better, try po'
Our waiter seemed to really care about getting us to the show on time, and made some good reccomendations on the menu for doing it.
Also, the staff will not allow you to substitute a side dish or accommodate anything that differs from what's on the menu.
Our waiter was inattentive throughout the meal, took nearly 3 hours for dinner.
We waited in the bar area and had an excellent time waiting for dinner with the bartender and staff.
Don't let the all-Italian menu intimidate; the waitstaff patiently translates each item.
The waitress never came back to get drink refills and we didn't get water until we were halfway through our dinner.
We were put on the wait list, seated in 15 min after a quick drink at the bar and had an incredibly entertaining waiter and dined next to a few regulars who raved.
After ordering a good amount of sushi the waiter asked me if that was all I wanted.
The guy was pleasant and friendly but that only goes so far when you are hungry and have to wait 2 hours for a pizza.
For 2 patrons paying over $100 for dinner, you'd think that the waiter would check to see if everything was okay with the dining experience, and he certainly did not.
Even a modest bottle of wine was accurately described by the wait staff and pleasing.
Buffet fare is better than the regular menu and you don't have to deal with the waitstaff.
When she wasn't being sarcastic or downright rude, she spent her time studiously ignoring our table or pointing us out to the other waitstaff.
Our spastic waiter was running around like a chicken with his head cut off, and, thus, slow to take our order, slow to bring us our drinks (they sat on the bar for 5-10 minutes) and slow to get us the water we had to ask for repeatedly.
Also, neither our waiter or busboy ever came back to ask if we wanted more to drink or even refill our WATER glasses.
Sit at the bar and eat here regularly and the sushi chef who is also the owner will hook you up the best cuts of fish.
service is quick, not overly friendly, but hey it's a small place and the servers are constantly busy.
PS : to the waitresses and waiters at Shanghai Cafe(new name of Shanghai Gourmet) if you don't like your job, don't work there.
Despite the servers' best intentions, it's easy to feel rushed while perusing the menu -- an awkwardly large blackboard.
As we looked at the menu and the wine list, my friend overheard the manager comment to a waitress about me that the least he could do is wear a button down shirt, and not show up dressed like a Gristede's boxcutter.
I said, that would be fine and had the hostess confirm my reservation before hanging up.
After waiting to get a table for over a half hour even though we had reservations, we went up to the host.
Deborah, the chef and co-owner, is an extraordinary talent - she has not received the notoriety she deserves - and her food, while not expensive, really merits a two or three star rating.
* Rude waiter - he kept pushing us to get appetizer (after been told twice that we would like to start ordering entree) and after dinner, told us to check out the shelf ourselves on our way to the restroom for dessert menu.
We asked for the check and had to wait 20mins for the waitress to come back and take our card.
But overall loved the place, outside of our waiter who literally tried to force us into ordering drinks.
After losing our reservation the staff at March called 24 hours later to apologize and ask if we would still like to dine there.
My wife and I had an 8:30 reservation, we show up a few minutes before and the host mumbles something to us about waiting at the bar and they'll tell us when the table is ready.
) My date and I were greeted by the host and informed there would be a slight wait.
The entire restaurant staff was disappointing to begin with (any waiters over 17 with some knowledge of the menu or wine?
But a server coming up to the table chewing gum while she went through the specials is not my idea of professional.
The servers were snobby and got mad at me when I asked if they serve by the slice.
Knew we were in trouble when the waiter spilled our cocktails on the table and couldn't be bothered to bring new silverware.
Went for dinner last Friday night with 2 friends, and the staff was incredibly nice.
My one complaint: Even though we arrived at our reservation time, the host asked us to wait at the bar -- then forgot to seat us (I had to ask).
And the waiter actually replied, yes that's why it took you so long to get a reservation.
When I pointed this out to the waiter he told me that all of the lox is like that.
We had to wait 30 minutes before the waiter even came to our table and had to ask 4 times just to get a glass of water.
However when I returned to my table the waiter immediately came over and said So I guess we are celebrating a birthday here.
The waiters are sometimes grouchy and the decor doesn't change, but the food is always delicious and satisfying.
The lunch got a little bizarre when we asked the waiter how the joint got it's name, and he made his hands into cups in reference to placing them on a woman's breasts and said, No, not this.
The owner roasts his own meats and makes fabulous and interesting sandwiches--the house-roasted ham with celery-root salad and tomatoes on a baguette deserves a prize.
The Scene At this sleek spot on a relatively sparse stretch of Spring Street, regulars belly up to a small bar and greet owner Giorgio DeLuca, of Dean and DeLuca fame, with warm hugs.
After fifteen minutes, when nobody even took our drink order, I looked around to try to get our waitresses attention only to see she and about five others of the waitstaff were having an endless gabfest by the register.
Unfortunately, service was slow and when our server noticed we had not received our entree he comp'ed us two delightful margaritas - AND charged us only for appetizers , thereby cutting our bill in half.
When we finally got our waiters attention - and explained to him we were unhappy with our entrees, his demeanor changed completely, he took our dishes and walked away without taking another order for us or asking if he could get us anything else.
Our waitress was so fun- I wanted her to join us for dinner.
The waitress came back to our table several times to ensure we were well catered for.
The Food Chef Nao Sugiyama serves in the traditional kaiseki style--a kind of tasting menu consisting of between six and 12 small courses.
We waited for thirty minutes for our table, and after inquiring once about the status, we were rudely confronted by the hostess.
We were lucky because chef Gari was there when we visited, and himself prepared the platter for us.
On our second trip, our waiter had an attitude, was slow to bring/refill drinks, and we had to flag him down for EVERYTHING.
servers never ONCE asked how we were doing - they brought out food late and if extra additions were requested, they came out 20 min after.
As we were wrapping up a very rushed meal--appetizers were barely started when the entrees arrived crowding a table for two at which three were crammed--the hostess charged over and grabbed a half-full wine glass declaring thanks ladies, I'll get your check.
Our waitress (and the chef himself) helped us a bit with the Austrian cuisine where we had questions, and every recommendation was right on.
The waiter never once came back to our table to ask how our meal was OR if we needed another drink.
Our waitress' visits to our table were few and far between.
After making our party wait for about an hour past our reservation time (which we chalked up to it being a busy Friday night), they gave us a wobbly makeshift table that was set up in the path of the staff rushing out of the kitchen.
I was accompanied by foodies, yet the waiter treated the few questions people had about the menu as if he was dealing with diners who had never eaten at a decent restaurant.
I requested the waiter to seat us at a different table, and he was like 'its the same everywhere', and walked off.
Waiter ignored us, never asked if we needed anything, never received a dessert menu or asked if we wanted coffee, or even the check.
The food at Forest Hills was great, the service more than perfect, but but the ambience was too hot they do not have AC and the employes was sweating a lot , it was a nasty esxperience because I eat in front of the service that was sweating like animals.
To make matters worse, the waitress followed us out, and demanded that we leave a better tip.
We ordered the recommended dessert ahead of time as they suggested but when it came time for it, the waiter had forgotten it.
The waiter knows us now, and the owner bought us a round of drinks once because the dessert took too long (in his opinion, we didn't even complain).
After each of them had had one drink, one of the managers came up to our table and told us that he no longer felt comfortable serving us any more margaritas.
The staff even went out of their way to print up menus without prices at my request, since the dinner party was my treat.
However, you're bothered by things like sub-par food (don't get the cajun fries), waiters who hate you and anything that looks like you, close proxmitity with strangers, and cheap talking and singing skelletons, do NOT go.
Our reservation was for 9, didn't get seated until 9:20 with no acknowledgment by the staff of the delay.
At the end of the meal, I politely asked the waitress whether she would comp something, and she said yes.
The last three times I've called (in addition to asking me to wait for a long time before taking my order), they've given me grief about asking for delivery even though my address is clearly within the map printed on the menu, just because the delivery guy gets mad if he has to go out of his way.
WHen I politely asked for a water he pointed to the waiter and looked the other way!
Our waiter didn't even bothered to ask for dessert.
The main floor space is lovely, but cavernous (which means *VERY* noisy), so our server was especially patient with us since we couldn't hear each other or her half the time.
Our waiter didn't really know the menu and was not attentive.
The daily fresh fish can be remarkably good, served in a variety of combinations, ranging up to the omakase chef's choice dinner.
Our waiter forgot about us for long periods of time and never even offered us a dessert menu.
The only problem we had was with an incompetent waitress and floor manager which slowed down our food and seating.
None of us were able to get drinks in a timely fashion, and the bartender was EXTREMELY rude to us.
We arrived at Crema at 7:50 and the hostess advised she had no record of my reservation.
The waitress had the gall to ask us to close out our check when she brought our food so she could go home rather than wait for us to finish (hey babe we waited for YOU, you can wait for US).
The hostess failed to give us menus, and we had to ask our waiter for them.
the 3rd however, the waiter forgot to put in our order for food and we ended up waiting an hour for them (b/c they were really busy).
When the bill finally arrived, the head waiter sternly told us that this time is okay, but next time you have to order more than 2 appitizers and a main course!
The waiters knocked over my purse 3 times and spilled water on the table 3 times as well.
ASK for spice adjustments or for special orders, if you think you'll need them, BUT most dishes are GREAT as the staff prepares them.
Waiters poured wine like water, my guests were wondering out loud if they would get straws for the wine next.
The waiters were rude, and the appetizer dip had bits of bread in it from someone else's dinner.
The hostess was totally not accomadating, and even though there were empty tables they still didn't seat us!
When they brought out the food the waiter dropped one of the plates right in front of us and didn't appologize or bring us out a complimentry plate.
I had to chase down our waitress for the food and the bill.
Waitress was unenthusiastic and refilled my water only after I asked her to but did not refill my date's empty water glass?!?!?
We were told by the front door hostess since we didn't have a reservation, it would be about 45mins for a table, but we could wait at the lounge and they would get us when our table was ready.
4-Got attitude from the waitress at every moment she was at the table.
Went with three people last saturday night - half way through our entrees we tried to order a second bottle of wine - both the hostess and waitress told us no, cause, ehh, the place is very crowded this night guys.
Also the waiter anever asked if the steaks were cooked to out liking or if we wanted anything else.
Sadly, many people feel the need to berate their server for a stronger drink.
it's a joy to watch the chef work, who refused to take my order but seeing him open my live scallop made me understand why.
Our server was just fantastic, she recommended that we order a lot of different dishes, so we did, we tried almost everything on the menu, we were a party of six and the whole group enjoyed everything.
We got there a bit early and the staff wasn't ready for us but we didn't mind b/c we got to wait by the beautiful bar.
Great place to meet friends or co workers for drinks, dinner or both.
At the end of our meal, I approached the waitress and asked that they not charge us for the $25 appetizer.
we completed our cocktails long before the waiter brought our starters (which did not come until 30 minutes after we had been seated).
Well, the manager rudely informed us that this was how the food is supposed to be served (one course every 30 or so minutes) and then claimed that Oliva is NOT a tapas restaurant.
The singing wait staff are great, the food is just awful!!
After waiting 40 minutes for a table and 30+ for our entrees, our waiter was distracted.
When I couldn't hear any of my selections in the dining room, the manager told me that the broken speakers in were 'not his fault'
: after ordering a bottle of wine (which was originally, inexplicably mistaken for 2 glasses of it), the (2) waitresses in charge of the outdoor space claimed that the bottle was right there in the only cooler used to service about 10 tables.
This was after we told the clueless hostess we only wanted to have drinks, and she seated us at a table.
Even some of the staff that was working that night was served their dinner before my table got our dinner entrees.
Although the wait staff was friendly, the atmosphere was not.
i won't be going back, and i'll tell all my friends not to go--you guys could have the best mussels in the whole world, but that waitress must be keeping a lot of customers away.
Within 10 minutes of being seated at our table, the hostess asked us if we could move.
We were just settling the bill, when a waiter I can only assume held a controlling interest in the restaurant (else he would've been fired long ago) came to the table and demanded to know why someone (our friend who'd briefly left to use the restroom) had left her beer half-full.
The waiter was attentive but not overbearing and gave good recommendations on the cocktails.
the waiter never asked if we would like more drinks, we had to flag him down and ask him and then when he brought them he forget two of them.
You should not go to a Brazilian BBQ place and have to chase the waiters and go to the hostess ASKING FOR MEAT.
At best, it's a mediocre restaurant, forget about the fish variety, I asked for Char (A sushi staple), and received a blank look from the waiter, same fish here as any grocery store.
Half an hour after our appetizer was cleared, the waiter told us it would take more time to get our main courses.
The food is decent, average bistro food, the decor is nice, but the service is poor, the waiters always seems to have to many tables andcant keep up with a good services.
I was shocked to have gotten no apology from the management, and to top it off were charged for the drinks we had while patiently waiting for food that never arrived.
the staff were pleasant and easy-going and took time to explain the specials to us as well as answer any questions we might have had.
In fact, our waiter mis-pronounced many of the items on the menu.
The waiter became visibly irritated when we didn't want to order any drinks at the start of the evening.
As soon as he sat, a waiter came over not once but twice, the first time to suggest he move to the bar b/c our large booth didn't accomodate an extra person, the second time to insist he move.
When her boyfriend told the host that she would like to keep her seat as it was, he grabbed a chair and slammed it down very hard on the floor.
Don't they teach their staff how to pour water or wine?
After arriving for a pre-theatre reservation to find the kitchen closed due to a mechanical failure, the problem was fixed an hour later (after many drinks at the bar, none of which management offered as a concession to the wait) and we were served a very good dinner in time to make the play.
I only saw one waitress for the entire place, and small as it is, she only came to our table to take our order and take away plates, not once asking us if our food was to our liking.
When I go out for dinner which is quite often, I have never encountered such rudeness from a waiter or owner as I did at this smoke filled, tight spaced, cash only restaurant.
Also, overheard gent at the next table complaining to the manager about his food.
Service only so-so -- I saw a lot of wait staff standing around, and at the busiest moment, I watched waiter stroll through the dining room with two plates as if he had all the time in the world.
Our plates were taken before we finished eating and our waitress sent the hostess to tell us we had to leave to make room for the next table and that we had to pay before we left.
Sure, the hostess can be rude, but when in the mood for authentic Mexican food, there is no better place in NYC, yet.
The waitress had zero knowledge about wine, and even knowledge about the dishes they were serving.
The Server took the order and disappeared for the entire rest of the night until we had to stop him b/c the bus boy knocked over our entire bottle of red wine soaking the white table cloth, the seats and our business suits.
I have dined here for over 20 years and I know the management will NOT compromise the cuisine for any haute trendy fare.
To sum it up: Service varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok.
The food did not come out on time or together and the waiter never came to explain why.
I saw a waitress yell at 2 customers for moving a table out a little bit in order to have more seating space.
We first got a table next to a VERY loud speaker and had no view, but the waiter was kind enough to move us when we asked.
They have recently fired their staff and brought in new people who dont even know how to serve a beer, I might add you are on average paying $6.
While being shown to our table by a hostess, we were welcomed by Lidia Bastianich herself and seated at a great table in the dining room -- not too secluded, but not noisy.
but when tables began to clear up, it seemed polite to seat us comfortably in the dining area instead of having us twist our backs to talk, perched on bulky high chairs at the bar with no place to put our handbags (which the waiter happened to drop and expose contents later on).
We had to ask FIFTEEN TIMES for water, we had no idea what we were eating (due to incomprehensible serving staff), waited 25 minutes after asking for our bill, and were charged a 20% corking fee ON WINE WE BOUGHT THERE.
We ordered whole wheast toast; the waiter didn't bring it until 15 minutes after we had received our brunch.
Without reservations on a Friday night at 8:30 I was promptly seated and given top-notch recommendations from both the host and my waiter.
i was at opia january 5, 2006 we had some drinks, dinner, i have to say that we had me and my friend great time, the staff was listening, the manager knew what he was doing and the food better than ever!!
Not only did it take them 45 minutes to serve a salad, when we complained, the manager was abusive, told us to get out and literally started clearing the table while we were still eating.
The waitress made a mental note about it and brought out a special dessert without being asked.
Upon calling to reserve a table outside for Brunch, the manager requested a cc nbr to secure the table for 6 (I was 8 months pregnant and there was a little baby).
At one point, the waiter told us that he couldn't find our wine!
The service on our visit was absolutely awful - a waiter and two helpers couldn't get our orders right and ignored several pleas for basics such as water and beverage refills and utensils to eat desserts with.
for our entree without a waiter in sight.
Our waitress was pleasent and patient as we asked about all the various types of sushi.
At the end of the meal the waitress asked if we wanted another drink, the after agreeing to have one she stated, actually there's a list of people waiting, can you go next door to the bar.
First of all we ordered a wine from the menu listed as 2000 but the waiter brought the 2001 vintage and tried to pass it off as the 2000.
Waiter took our drink order and then we didn't see him for 15 minutes.
Our waitress took our order and then NEVER came back to our table.
When we sat down, the waiter barely looked in our direction and abruptly shoved our menus on the table.
Extremely RUDE servers who intially took our order and never returned with drinks or to see if we required anythign else.
1) Service is very slow and unattentive (10 minutes for our server to come by with our menus and to take our drink order, another 10 to bring the drinks/take our dinner order, you get the idea.
the waiters had a really hard time remembering to bring drinks, and when they did they were not what was ordered.
Having dined there over a half-dozen I have tried everything on the menu but depending on what night, time and who is taking your order, be prepared for loud, smokey (it is a bar afterall) and herbed waitstaff.
I made reservations one week in advance and although I had to change it at the last minute, the hostess was very accommodating and we got seated promptly upstairs overlooking the Buddha.
Needless to say, we weren't suprised when our server told us he never put our appetizer order in.
Went with my father without a reservation, and the maitre d' was very nice and sat us within 15 minutes of our arrival - we had been told that the wait would be an hour (this may be unusual).
The cooks in the front are very friendly and helpful.
However the manager, who refused to come to our table to discuss it, said we were wrong (through the poor waitress) and would not replace our bottle.
Yes, hard not to look at the waitresses (and they're really good servers), but as I'm reminded by everyone who knows Hooters, they don't rank anywhere near the girls at the Hooters locations South of the ol' Mason-Dixon.
The space is a bit cramped and the waitress seemed to avoid eye contact at all costs, however, I would recommend you go just for the food.
for instance, i sat next to this couple who experienced problems with their food and the asked to speak to a manager.
i got a steak special that was way overpriced ($12 more then the steak on the menu and no warning from the waitress) and it was cooked to the wrong temperature.
The waiter set down my companion's meal and didn't return with my dish for some time.
This set off our critical eye: ceramic bowls having edges higher than the table votives hid the fact that the food was presented cafeteria-style; a rolling-eyed waiter pushing water; the awkward Italian menue gimmick; and the bill.
After admitting that the items on the bill were not in line with the menu, the manager reserved the right to price at her own discretion!
Was greeted and seated with no attitude from the host and hostess, despite no reservation.
Ten minutes later the manager relented and dropped off a glass of water with an upturned nose.
they waited to get us water after they took our food orders, which took the waitstaff a long time to do.
Be careful with the waiting list- the hostess skipped over our party on the list as we sat waiting for a table, for over an hour.
The Food The owners' visits to farmers' markets in Brooklyn drive the ingredient-centric New American menu, which changes about once a month.
We tried to get the manager who flatly refused to come to our table and discuss the problem with us.
After scrunching into the tiny bar area and ordering a drink, I was annoyed but couldn't help but notice the handsome bartender having a tete-a-tete with another French-speaking cutie.
The place was empty with three waiters working and it still took 15 minutes to bring us menus.
Our waitress kept forgetting our drinks.
Our last experience: Waiting for a table at the bar (we always make reservations), the bartender ignored us until my husband intervened with one of the owners.
Waitress was nice but didnt know some specials and was alittle off, think she was new.
the waitress never asked us how the food was or if we needed anything.
My complaint was with the service-- our waitress was rather pushy and visibly annoyed when we didn't order appetizers or dessert.
The bartender virtually ignored us while we waited, took 15 minutes to get drinks.
Then the waitress became upset when she returned with the drinks and we didn't stop our conversations quick enough to remind her who had ordered what only 5 minutes prior.
Oh, and kudos to the hostess who appeared out of thin air with extra napkins just moments after a glass of water was knocked over - she's upping the bar on service here.
The waiter appeared promptly, took our order, bought us drinks and was never to be seen again.
Staff wouldn't take no for an answer on pitchers of sangria.
service was attentive at the beginning but the waiter lost us towards the end and we had to flag them down for the check.
Then the waiter came back for our food order at 10, and we hadn't received our drinks yet.
Other than making the grill flame at the beginning our hibatchi chef didnt put on much of a show - no flipping stuff into is hat or our plates - so if that is your thing go to Benihani.
The waiter accidently spilled water on our table, and the manager checked up on our meal periodically and offered us a free after diner drink.
When the spastic waiter finally stopped by our table, we told him we were going to order everything at once b/c we were getting pretty hungry.
My mother and I had our chairs bumped over a dozen times by hasty waiters.
However, when our waitress realized her faux pas, an extra glass of wine was sent to our table and all was forgiven.
when I came back for brunch a week or so later, I was told that the marscapone version was no longer being served, because there was a new cook.
We weren't even offered a dinner menu and the waitress didn't even notice that we wanted drinks until after I ordered them from the bar myself.
On the top of everything at the end of the dinner the waiter gave us the wrong check.
When we finally ordered our wine, the waitress brought the bottle of wine over with ONE GLASS MISSING - meaning, we'd have to wait even longer for the final glass to arrive - which were all piping hot from the dishwasher.
The last time I was there (last week) our food took a little too long and a manager promptly apologized and offered to comp our desserts (not expected but appreciated).
I called to confirm the reservations on the morning of the lunch and the hostess had the reservations set for 12:30pm which I quickly corrected.
Our waiter was a little stressed and brought a couple things out late and as a result, he apologized graciously and gave us wine on the house to compensate for the delay.
The waitress came back with the bill and money (with a calculator) and asked for more tips.
For dessert the waiter reccomended his favorite which was a Torreja.
Thanks to waiter I learned so much about wine too.
Each week, Zutto's sushi chef never ceases to amaze me with new concoctions.
Our waitress forgot to bring me another margarita, but somehow she managed to get it on the bill.
Chef Shea Gallante takes up residence in the former kitchen of Waxman, now walled off from the diners but visible through glass service doors.
We were given only one waiter for 20 people, and it honestly took over 1/2 an hour to get coffee (I actully went across the street to Dunkin Donuts!)
No bread basket for the table, the server came around with a basket and we each got 1 piece of bread.
The food is pretty good, but the staff would rather be anywhere than waiting tables at Maison.
The waitress was slow and had to ask the kitchen first every time we asked her about anything on the menu.
Although the restaurant was far from crowded (maybe three tables), service was abysmally slow, to the point that we wondered if the server was trying to avoid us.
They seem under staffed and Waiters do not really know the menu.
she never once checked on us after serving our drinks, we asked another waitress about our sandwiches, she attempted to check on them but didn't really get an answer.
But the wait staff's attitude will make me rethink about returning.
To top it off, when we mentioned it to our lovely waitress, she responded as though it was no big deal along with Well now you know for the next time.
from the hostess to the bartender to the waiter (who told us that we had to leave because the tables needed to be turned around more quickly even though it was a friends engagement dinner).
Our waiter did not come back once to reserve our wine.
We told the waitress we'd like the fries hot with our main courses but she only ordered more once the rest of the food had arrived so we didn't get them until we were half way through.
We received our food and coffee at the same time, and couldn't get the attention of any waiter to refill our cups.
The service was spotty as a couple of drink orders were forgotten and the waiter didn't really come to check on us.
Costs could be better - expect to be upsold by the hovering wait staff - and come for the authentic tastes, not the interior decor (looked a littel like Cheers!
THe bartendars were right on top of getting us our wine and setting up free blue cheese dip and chips for us.
True, the ambiance is something out of Goodfellas, but it the food and waiters are out of this world!
Once we ordered, it took at least 30 minutes to get our food, with our server no where in site.
Instead, Yasuda's swarm of waiters and waitresses hovered incessantly overhead, seizing any opportunity to fill a glass, reorganize the table, ask if we were done, and of course clear us out of there in under 80 min.
Waited an hour for the food to come out, couldnt even find the waitress.
Got the check tossed on table 10 minutes after being served and hostess came by to rush us some more.
However when the party was complete we had the other waitress come over who said that we had to order all the food at once and couldnt order just appetizers.
Server was nonexistent; when we flagged her down, she told us that the food was 'being plated' when clearly they were just starting to prepare it.
Those appetizers only appeared after we complained to the manager.
I did not like the place because: -it took the waiter over 20 min to take our order and then over an hour until we got our food.
And the owner didnt seem to care, she was more interested in talking at the bar than hearing from me.
On Friday night the busboy was sulky verging on rude; he brought the fries (ordered for the entrees) twice before the appetizers came and then again the minute we'd finished them and looked put out to be asked to take the empty plates away.
Sure, the waitresses are hot, but you'll have to wait 30 minutes just to get your drinks.
Even when the chef is not in the house, the food and service are right on target.
I chose Guastavinos for my wedding reception dinner (for 19 of us) and planned it through their private dining staff.
this guy should work in a dinner ,didn't even know the menu ,he couldn't explain me anythings ,a real nightmare.
The service was terrible- our waiter was unable to make any recommendations, mumbled the special and failed to check back during the course of our meal.
Took the waiter 10 minutes to get to our table, and another 15 minutes until the coffee I ordered arrived.
When it came time to get the check, they couldn't seem to determine which of the servers had it.
Cheeses get short shrift by waitstaff, who all seem hurried.
Fortunately the waitress was very ncie about this, and did not give me a hassle about taking the cake off the final bill.
The waiter got aggravated when we explained how we wanted our entrees prepared.
We waited an hour for our appetizers, (I suspect the waitress forgot to put in our order because the restaurant was not busy) and then the entrees came at the same time!
Since we had to wait, we decided to get a drink but the bartender ignored us even when we made it known that we would like to order a drinks.
do not take the reservation at 8pm to begin with, if in reality the management knows that it will be impossible to seat at that time.
After an hour of waiting at an overcrowded bar with our coats in our hands and no room to move, I approached the host (who never bothered to give us an update throughout our wait) to ask him how much longer, He was incredibly rude and dismissed me with his hand and walked away from me while I was trying to talk to him!
When the manager came over, he accused my friend of offending the chef and continued to argue with her about the dish.
At any rate, the waiter totally forgot about us and we had to hail him down a couple of times just to get the specials and to order.
From the opera playing in the background, to Emilio, the owner wishing everyone a good meal, this should be the highest rated Italian restaurant in the city.
The waiter rushed us through the last half of our dinner because they were turning the room into a dance floor.
My first and LAST visit included a waiter telling me We're casual- pour your own wine and then handing me a check with a place for the Captain's tip.
Most laughable moment of night was when waiter offered me a free drink to make up for th 50 minute appetizer wait.
The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.
Bartender, should not be taking dinner orders on napkins.
Generally one would have to point out to the waitstaff the beer was flat and ask for another.
About the food we had a little difilculty keeping the orders straight ,the menu has too many choices,but the server was very helpul and suggested de paella valenciana which was extremele delicious.
As the night rolls on the place turns into a bar/lounge so the wait staff is constantly rushing you to eat up and move out, not the kind of atmosphere you want for the price you are paying for your entree.
The server came by only once to pour additional wine for the table; the rest of the time, we had to fish the bottle out of the two-table communal bucket ourselves.
This is a busy spot from 1130 AM to 130 PM M-F but you never have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table, unless you have a large party, thanks to fast and friendly service provided by the waitstaff and kitchen.
The appetizer came out cold and the waiter came and took it to the kitchen.
When we sat down - our waiter did not know what to recommend - neither food nor wine.
There were many helpful people, not only one waiter - kept refilling the water, the wine, asking if everything was okay.
The staff were very friendly, the prices were relatively average, not bad, and the food was great.
Staff dissappeared after 2PM and we had to send a search party to find our waitress who was parked at a table upstairs reading a newspaper.
There are several specials that change daily, which the servers recite from memory.
If people are late, you could lose your reservation and/or the staff does pressure you to start ordering even if your whole party hasnt arrived.
The line is long, but the staff keeps it moving and usually everyone is friendly.
The waiter, Momir, was on top of everything the whole time-not to mention entertaining us by constantly hitting on the two blond souther girl sitting at the table next to us-- and the free wine and after dinner espressos were much appreciated.
wait staff have no room to get to tables because of overflow from bar area, and knocked into the back seats of our table constantly.
My doubts were cleared immediately, the host was friendly and yes they suggest the pitcher of sangria before you look at the menu but you should take it anyway!
Waiters were pretty slow, didnt refill my glass of water until I was about to leave, and I had to ask several times to get the check and the slices of lemon.
Today I placed a lunch order and the guy hung up on me while I was saying thank you!
Our appetizers came out the same time as our entree and our waitress disappeared quite frequently.
The waiter brought out the same dish three times during the meal.
Instead of doing so, the manager came to our table and told us he'd be happy to take our orders off if we didn't like the way he ran his restaurant.
Conversation went like this: waiter: presented the steak and said 'Meduim well'
i took another 45 minutes so i called back the waiter and said that if the food was ready now ill just pay for it.
They took 10 minutes to refill our water, they never asked if we would like another drink, and the waiter was nice but just not efficient.
The whole time we were waiting the hostess kept talking to us, telling us we wouldn't lose our reservation, and even gave us free blue margarita shots!
It was super busy, but our waiter still had time to chat, and knew the menu very well.
We could not believe that the owner only laughed and continued serving him drinks.
seated promptly; while waitstaff seemed confused as to what they should be doing (one actually looked at my partner's mojito and asked if she had 'put her dinner in the glass'), our waiter appeared experienced.
The waitress saw a couple of us struggling with the menu and I felt she was frustrated with us.
Last visit, ignored by our waiter, we finally got beers and ordered food.
the waitress came to ask me how my NY Strip was, and I could not give her an answer b/c no one gave me a steak knife.
Then I ordered a margarita,rocks w/ salt, the waitress' replied:I don't think we have salt What do you cook your food with?
Asked for recommendations, waitress said read everything on the menu which already wasn't to unique.
We had a few toro and white tuna sashimi as well as a couple roll like the park avenue (which was not listed on the menu but recommended by the waiter) and the paris match roll.
He let us be seated, but told the hostess to make sure we didn't get menus until it was our arrival time.
We were told by the hostess to make sure we were on time for our reservation, which we were, but then they kept us waiting for 15 minutes when we got there.
I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again.
The pretty waitstaff is always pleasant, but service is inconsistent at best.
Further, our waiter was basically inattentive through the entire dinner (e.
The owner Don greeted us at the door with a warm smile, and seated us for dinner upstairs.
Even with reservations, we had to wait 20 minutes until our server came to take our order, then waited an HOUR 10 minutes for our food!
When I got the bill and saw I was billed separately for each cup of coffee, I asked the waiter if he could do anything since the menu doesn't even list drinks and the manager said no.
As a chef I really appreciated the well executed dishes that were full of crisp and vibrant flavor contrast acting in harmony and perfect balance.
The manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else.
Our waitress was merely inattentive at first but became just plain hostile after we had the nerve to ask about the wine we had ordered to go with dinner (we were halfway through our entrees and still no wine).
I complained to the manager who offered to move us and pay for our appetizers.
Even more impressive, when my vegetarian girlfriend started asking whether certain dishes were made with meat, the waiter offered to have a vegetable plate created for her -- and it was quite well done too.
Later, as our large party began filtering out, I overheard our waiter discussing the menu mixup to about 5 members of the staff, blaming us.
The waitstaff can be hard to track down and uninformed about the menu.
The staff knows all about the food and the Chef is very visible visiting tables and overseeing the dining room.
In the 20 minutes we spent waiting just for a server to take our wine order, the host of this establishment proceeded to let couple after couple walk right in in-front of us because he obviously knew them.
The waitress asked us if we'd be eating dinner.
The DJ at the bar kept the place alive.
Our waiter was well versed with the menu and provided us with great service, he didn't hover over the table as some servers tend to do in high end restaurants.
also, when i was waiting to be seated the bartender gave great service and mixed a mean cocktail for me.
The wait staff rushed us through our meal, took away our food before we were finished (even though we told them we were still eating) and then, as we were lingering over the bill, asked us to leave.
i went there for dinner on friday night, the waiter had a terrible attitude.
Our Peruvian waiter was very nice, and the food was ok, but forget about ordering an expensive bottle of wine there.
We let the very kind hostess know we were there and had some drinks at the bar.
The waitresses and the diners have to scream at one another to give an order.
We had a reservation and 2 of us showed up on time and notified the hostess that we were there but the other 2 were running a few minutes late.
There are only 8-10 tables, so you receive a lot of attention from the waiters, which is good.
My friend and I did have to wait a few minutes for a table, but only because Amanda Hesser (the new NY Times food critic) showed up and, obviously, needed a copious level of attention from the greetings staff.
