0	3	2	Hostess was extremely accommodating when we arrived an hour early for our reservation.
1	3	2	We were a couple of minutes late for our reservation and minus one guest, but we didn't think we deserved the attitude we got from the hostess.
2	3	2	Although we arrived at the restaurant 10 min late, the hostess did not have a table for us.
3	3	1	I like the smaller portion size for dinner.
4	3	2	The bill was surprisingly inexpensive considering we each had appetizers, an entree, dessert and drinks (alcoholic and non) we also had 3 rounds of shots for the entire table.
5	3	1	) other food is served in too-small portions, but at least it leaves room for dessert.
6	3	2	It was very loud, I felt too crowded, the man chair's next to me made it impossible for the waiters to pass.
7	3	0	After ordering drinks, we both decided on the Paella Vallenciana, brought out on hot plates.
8	3	0	Portions are fairly generous and the staff brings out multiple little bites and treats throughout dinner.
9	3	2	I had to ask for bread for the table (several times).
10	3	0	Specialty drinks--alcoholic and non--arrive in skull mugs or mini-canteens, nifty take-home souvenirs.
11	3	2	I was told by the hostess that a specific table would be mine once the customers left and I waited 45 minutes for that to happen.
12	3	2	And there wasn't much room for the people at the bar to stand either, as the restaurant attempted to squeeze as many tables into the restaurant as they could, forcing those dining to have to shift in their chairs every time a waiter attempted to get by.
13	3	2	As if that wasnt enough, after another in the group mentioned that a portion of the sushi on her plate was not what she had ordered, the waiter came back with chopsticks and started to remove it (as she was eating!)
14	3	2	The waiter was just throwing our dishes on the table without even clearing the appetizer plates and then they started clearing the food when we weren't even finished yet.
15	3	2	Before we can even order desert, the waitress comes and tells us we have to leave because the host wanted our table.
16	3	1	On ouor visit, our reservation was ignored and then we were asked to move from our seats at the bar, where we were told to wait, because we were not drinking enough.
17	3	0	The Scene The entrance leads into a dim, narrow bar decorated with sake bottles, exposed brick and a beautiful arched wooden ceiling.
18	3	2	It also has great ice cream and spumoni ices.
19	3	1	However, the drinks are very good and this place is alright for brunch, if you don't mind sitting in a very cramped spot and/or waiting on line.
20	3	2	The ONLY negative was when we asked the waiter to secretly bring birthday cake and some other desserts for the table.
21	3	2	Sometimes, the take-out and seating lines can be long, but the staff help move things along.
22	3	2	I went to Sushiden on a Friday night around 8:00, the place was pretty empty, we had reservations, but we didnt need them.
23	3	1	THE DECOR HAS BEEN UPDATED TO A FULL BLOWN RESTAURANT BUT THE QUALITY AND THE QUANTITY HASN'T CHANGED.
24	3	2	A+  was planning a party for my staff, and was treated rudely by another restaurant when trying to add more people to reservation (a simple no would have worked).
25	3	2	Smiling servers quiz diners with movie trivia, but forget to fill their water glasses.
26	3	2	Chef Anthony is warm and is always fixing up something unique and tasty in the kitchen to send to your table.
27	3	1	The food at Parish was tasy and well-prepared, but the portions were absurdly miniscule, especially in proportion to the prices.
28	3	0	considering the prices on the menu, i'd rather go somewhere else where they know how to refill water and real chairs for everyone, something you can even get at mcdonald's.
29	3	2	After spending over $500 on a business dinner, a manager knelt down at our table and asked us to quote, wrap it up and move to the bar.
30	3	2	Friendly staff happily accepted a reservation (for 10), and when only 6 showed up, they couldn't have been more understanding!
31	3	1	Recently I purchased a dish to go, and found that all of my meal contained just one large piece of ginger root.
32	3	1	The numbness in your lower legs from sitting on old wood chairs is more than compensated by the wonderful food.
33	3	2	Went here for a casual Sunday night dinner at 7:45pm; dinner was served at 10:15pm!
34	3	0	This is not haute cuisine, but that' part of what I love about it - it has an honest, intimate feel with no pretensions, just like eating in an Italian family's home.
35	3	1	The food was so-so and you would think it was a french resturant, the portions were so tiny.
36	3	2	Eventually another waiter cleaned up the table and allowed us to sit there.
37	3	2	However the hostess completely ignored us, we waited 40 min at the bar (even with reservation), our waitress was incredibly uninterested in us (never even offered dessert menus) and the somelier could have taken a look at the label before he made a mistake about his favorite wine.
38	3	0	The Scene Flanked by a diner-style bar on one side and glass cases of sweets on the other, General Store resembles a cozy mom-and-pop rest stop on the way through Pennsylvania Dutch country--minus the cheesy gift shop.
39	3	2	Since it's a small place, it's best to get there early for dinner as the wait can be quite long if you don't make a reservation.
40	3	0	The prices are incredibly reasonable, especially considering the HUGE portions - by noodle soup could have fed both my husband and myself.
41	3	1	There is a huge line, usually a 45 minute wait; they take no reservations and no tables of more than five people.
42	3	2	The pizzas are a MUST TRY, hence the name.
43	3	2	I went there with family and even though we had reservations, we were seated 30 minutes late, the food took 45 minutes to arrive and when I got the wrong order, I had a hard time trying to find the server.
44	3	2	However, it takes ages to get seated (even with a reservation), and the waiters don't seem very knowledgeable about the menu (or receptive to questions).
45	3	2	We complained to our waiter serveral times about this and the stares continued and to top it all off as the manager walked around to each table asking if they enjoyed their dinner, he conveniently did not ask us!
46	3	2	He is a gracious chef who comes to the table and greets the guests.
47	3	0	Once we were seated our water order was taken promptly but they never came back with a menu.
48	3	2	You have to be comfortable eating with your hands, sharing the same plate with your friends and be able to handle spicy food (not as spicy as some thai dishes though).
49	3	1	The portions were overly generous for both the apps and entrees without sacrificing the quality.
50	3	2	We arrived on a Thursday night at 6:30 and were seated immediately (they don't take reservations), but, this small place filled up very quickly, and the bar was overflowing with people when we left.
51	3	2	Spoke with the manager about comping a round, after we had already paid for 2 rounds waiting for the table.
52	3	0	As for the main attraction, the pies are known for their crisp outer edge and gooey middle, and feature the unorthodox layering of sauce over mozzarella.
53	3	2	The high prices and small portions reflect the hype of a new Battali restaurant as well as the cache that comes with having to make a reservation a week in advance only to wait to be seated.
54	3	0	Although the prices is a bit on the high, you do get big portions for it.
55	3	2	It was my birthday and although they came out with of a bottle of bub, I felt embarrassed about the lack of service.
56	3	2	The staff beginning with the tall gentleman at the door, waiters, etc.
57	3	1	The food and service was top notch, only the complain is that this place is so small that some seats are not made for a big guy.
58	3	2	The hostess was condescending and the waiter was somewhat absent and unaccomodating (sure, we made a reservation to sit outside but when I asked to be moved indoors after I heard thunder he didn't even try to make it happen, giving me a blank stare and a shrug when I asked what we would do if it rained).
59	3	0	The pieces were small but the fish was good quality and there wasn't a lot of rice to mess with.
60	3	1	Miyagi is my sushi restaurant of choice in the Village; it's never insanely crowded, the service is very sweet (I've never experienced any of the nastiness described in prior reviews), and the tabs are small.
61	3	2	The waitress came to our table and told us about their tempting specials.
62	3	1	We hung out by the bar mostly to ourselves, not an overwelming social crowd, but there were some georgous groups of hipsters looking like it was their meeting up before going out to the clubs (a few of the girls looked like top models), but the vibe was real chill.
63	3	0	The food is right out of heaven, arrive hungry because the portions are huge but not the prices.
64	3	1	I would recommend going at off-times (before 7 perhaps) to avoid the crowds as it gets packed and there isn't much room by the bar.
65	3	1	there's always people waiting to be seated and the chairs are not comfortable.
66	3	2	The waiter returned seconds later to complain that dozens of people wanted our table then poured her beer into a paper cup-- presumably to encourage us to leave faster.
67	3	2	The waitstaff is helpful and they'll get your favorite meats to circle your table more often if you just ask.
68	3	2	The food is not large and I could have had a few slices of pizza after I left.
69	3	1	It appeared that they used a cheese pizza cooked earlier that day or the day before and just added the raw topping to it, then delivered it.
70	3	0	The Romano family is very hands on with the father supervising the kitchen and Santo, the son, running the room with a high degree of personal attention.
71	3	2	The wait was long which is understandable but the waiters were rude to us while we waited, rushed us to order, ignored us while we ate and needed more drinks, and rushed us when they wanted the table for another couple.
72	3	0	The scene is pretty cool and the drinks are OK, but the food and service were pretty weak.
73	3	2	The four of us were seated in the outdoors patio(not requested) and suffered through a muddled menu, indifferent food, a below average waiter, as well as excessive noise, wind and cold.
74	3	1	True, the menu doesn't offer a wide range of choices and portions are not la all-you-can-eat, buffet style (but is that a negative thing after all?
75	3	0	We decided to get out of there and go to a safe place with bigger portions and normal food.
76	3	2	One oversight: the gf wanted tea to go along with the plate of yummies they gave me, but the server forgot to bring it since we took our time to finish the wine.
77	3	2	straining to read the menu under the low-lighting-tag-sale-chandelier motif, we were able to order a salad, tapas, and entrees from the first of several waiters, none of whom were able to introduce themselves, recommend dishes, present silverware, remove plates, or deliver water when asked.
78	3	2	I came here b/c someone gave a trashy review to my favorite coffee place (Grey Dog's) and compared it to this place so I had to see for myself what was so great about 71.
79	3	2	Another hostess came by and told us that since we were now 5 we were a different table and couldnt' stay.
80	3	2	We were even able to call in advance to make sure there was space at the bar because I was on crutches and the owner reserved the seats til we got there.
81	3	2	Charming atmosphere that seats probably no moroe than 35.
82	3	2	The actors try to draw your attention away from the better stuff that is happening below.
83	3	0	The small single room--wood panelling, large mirrors, white tablecloths, dim lighting--has few frills.
84	3	2	our waiter forgot a dish and we were constantly checked on afterwards and treated to a complimentary dessert for the mix up.
85	3	2	The staff had apparently booked the room for 2 groups with a 30 minute overlap.
86	3	0	The service is sweet and attentive, the wine is delicious and the new wine bar around the corner has the most amazing selection, as well as cheeses and tapas.
87	3	2	The Food The Portuguese knack for exploration couldn't be more apparent on the expansive menu, which moves beyond classics like bacalhau to encompass a world of former colonies along with the motherland.
88	3	2	The decor reminds me of Miami nightclubs, and we sat in a cool communal strip, where you share your table with people.
89	3	2	After a short 30 minutes of chatting and enjoying our drinks we were approached by the very pretentious Maitre D' who RUDELY demanded we order as our table was needed.
90	3	2	The menu includes the usual Chinese restaurant staples, but also includes a fairly diverse selection of other dishes not typically found in your average noodle house.
91	3	1	This pizza shop is one o fhte best places ever and is a hiden gem in a small community.
92	3	2	Tasting menu a mixed bag: lobster soup amuse with grapefruit intriguing, but marred by excess bitterness as prepared.
93	3	2	In addition, I've always found the waiters helpful with the wine selection, and there is always a good selection of wines by the glass.
94	3	1	Although the portions seemed a little diminutive at first, they turned out to be the perfect size once the dinner was over.
95	3	1	The food will eventually make you outweigh Anna Nicole Smith.
96	3	2	I was NOT told this before when I made the reservation and explained to the manager RICHARD who has the poorest customer service ever and rude and said he didn't believe me.
97	3	1	The food is decent but small portions so expect to order a lot.
98	3	2	I have seen the crowd go from ultra hip to BT and I still love it becuause of the food.
99	3	1	The scene is a bit much some time, but the food is worth it.
100	3	2	Even with reservation, it might take up to one hour to get a table and the staff might not even say a word about it.
101	3	2	When you crave comfort food, make a reservation and head to Piccolo Angolo, they never dissappoint.
102	3	0	My dinner partner ordered the angel hair with seafood - the portion was easily big enough for two.
103	3	0	All dishes are an incredible dining experience.
104	3	2	The Scene Strictly Roots, which opened more than a decade ago as a dietary alternative to Harlem's more cholesterol- and fat-heavy fare, wears its philosophy on its facade: We serve nothing that crawls, walks, swims or flies.
105	3	2	ONE OF THE BEST PIZZA IN BROOKLYN , NEED AN AC FOR SUMMER.
106	3	0	The menu is limited: chicken, rice beans, frozen fish (shrimp, whiting, crab sticks), and french fries, but one receives EXCELLENT value for the money and it is SO WORTH walking down the block for.
107	3	2	their Stella on tap was almost flat, i saw the bartender whisking our beers to give them any sort of head.
108	3	2	I managed to get the last reservation at 11:15pm during the week, and, upon entering the restaurant, my boyfriend and I were seated next to each other, hardly a romantic atmosphere!
109	3	1	Then the food came- TINY portions and plates came out in 15 min intervals.
110	3	2	Later two waiters decided to bodyguard our table; when my fork hits the plate it's snatched away.
111	3	2	They overfill the reservation sheet so that the check is dropped off nearly with your food and they are rushing you out of your booth before you are finished.
112	3	2	The waitress came to our table once for our order, but then we were tended to by who I thought was the hostess.
113	3	2	the peanut sauce came in a tiny plastic cup smaller than a shot glass.
114	3	2	Service was friendly, but not terribly attentive, took 30 minutes after dinner to clear our plates, and another 20 to get our check.
115	3	0	There is almost always an hour wait at dinner time, but this may be the best Japanese Sushi restaurant in NYC.
116	3	1	The service was okay, fast seating (for two), looked like a group nearby had been there a long time.
117	3	2	If you like a cleaner (more generic) flavor then other places may provide the norm.
118	3	0	For the most part I enjoyed my dining experience at Revival (not to be confused with the bar on 15th).
119	3	2	Martinis from the bar are mixed at the size of 1 1/2 drinks, and the wait staff leaves the whole glass there, returning to pour you your remaining drink as your glass empties.
120	3	2	After taking unusually long to bring the wine, the waiter could not open the bottle and had to get a different one.
121	3	2	When his to sons joined the mix they took Dads quest for the best food another step adding slowly to the menu a host of items that reflect the demigraphic of this still growing nabe.
122	3	2	The Scene Hunky waiters dub diners darling and it sounds like they mean it.
123	3	0	The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.
124	3	0	I usually run the other way when I hear of an Italian restaurant with huge portions, because it's usually a lot of mediocre food.
125	3	2	I had reservations for a week but was seated at the worst table in the room,against a wall near the entrance to the kitchen,very claustaphobic.
126	3	2	even if you have to wait for a spot at the bar to wait for your table, the music and design of the space create an ambiance that is simultaneously chic and comfortable - something extraordinarily difficult to find in this city.
127	3	0	The table next to us had hummus which looked delicious, so we really should have stuck to appetizers and wine.
128	3	2	I had my brand new $15 lip gloss on the table and the waiter threw it away.
129	3	2	07 menu was a deal to try this hip tribeca restaurant but the wrong dessert was sent to the table.
130	3	1	When my (pregnant) friend asked about a non-alcoholic version of a drink, the answer was simply no, with no further suggestions.
131	3	1	The $5 menu does have smaller portions, and I found the ravioli dish to be not too much better than a can of Chef Boyardee.
132	3	2	A reservation did not save us from a wait at the bar, but the food was worth it; a grilled calamari appetizier with mushrooms was delicious as was a mixed seafood pasta main course.
133	3	1	Food - mostly steak and fish - is decent, but the portions are obscene - filet mignon and salmon were HUGE, but they don't come with any side dishes - you have to order and pay extra for them which is inconvenient and expensive.
134	3	1	My entree was just some noodles in a butter sauce with no texture or color, except for a little bit of spinach which was more like a garnish.
135	3	0	Decor is simple yet functional and although the staff are not the most attentive in the world, you don't feel rushed and the food is good, hot with decent portion sizes and a good selection to suit most tastes.
136	3	2	Mixed drinks were Casino Quality we weren't sure if the sides on our tables were left from the previous diners, but when our steaks (Only one choice on the menu) arrived.
137	3	2	All the food was carefully prepared and the presentation was a cut above.
138	3	0	The menu is divided up into several sections, and most of the dishes are smallish plates, like tapas.
139	3	2	From having an appetizer, a glass of wine and reading a magazine to sitting by a table to work on my grades, to meeting other fellow teachers for a book club to partying with the owners all my experiences at Futura have always been extremely postive!
140	3	2	The Scene With its yellow slat walls, nautical art and well-worn oak bar, this onetime fishermen's lair is now a snug little neighbor to both South Street Seaport and the glass sequoias of nearby Wall Street.
141	3	2	One hour into our dinner, we were told by the hostess that we needed to hurry up and finish so that they could accommodate the next party's reservation.
142	3	2	true I had to wait longer for my table, but the ambience and the food definitely made up for it.
143	3	0	Decent value for decent chinese food for the area - obviously you can get cheaper down in chinatown.
144	3	0	They have Boylan's root beer, coffee that's freshly ground that day, and a relaxed casual atmosphere with friendly waitresses.
145	3	1	The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.
146	3	2	I was told they had one(early) reservation; felt deceived b/c when I left the place was empty!
147	3	0	A collection of stormy sea paintings and two mermaid figureheads hoisting lights above the bar set a lulled maritime mood.
148	3	2	I was shocked by the amount of butter used in the pork and lamb dishes -- the smell of butter was literally wafting off the plate!
149	3	1	Great food, but tiny portions and inexcusable service - disorganized, amateurish and definitely overpriced by a long shot.
150	3	0	while I think the menu could use better appetizers all of the main courses are DELICIOUS- also the service is so much better than the ratings.
151	3	2	Minutes turned into an hour-long wait with non-existent standing room.
152	3	2	Seated just after 2; I commend them 'cause they were the only decent brunch spot that would take our reservation, and they did their best to seat us promptly.
153	3	2	ten minutes after we ordered the waitress came to our table and told us we had ordered complicated entrees and we would be waiting for 45 minutes.
154	3	1	After I inquired why the food was taking so long, the waitress told us that the 2 dishes we ordered take a long time.
155	3	0	The Food The French-Belgian menu is small, but everything on it is satisfyingly savory, from a simple pot of mussels in a choice of sauces (beer and bacon, creamy mushroom, or white wine and garlic broth), to beef stewed with beer and prunes; from a juicy croque monsieur and beyond.
156	3	2	The loud belly dancer with her scarf dragging across my food and table, almost knocked over my water glass.
157	3	0	I'll second the recommedation for the Purity--which has much faster, better service at half the price and a whole lot more selection.
158	3	2	No table space and one of the angry neighbors decided to take matters into his own hands by throwing a bucket of water out his window and onto the patrons waiting for their tables.
159	3	2	I requested a Riesling and the waiter recommended staying with the Sencere which didn't come by the glass according to the menu but he provided it to us any ways.
160	3	0	The jukebox is always playing good tunes, and the patrons are never shy about getting up and dancing in the aisles, or even on the bar.
161	3	0	The place was jumping on a Mon nite, as was the bar, but with a nice mixed crowd.
162	3	2	At one point my friend knocked over a glass and broke it to pieces, and the waitstaff was so forgiving of it.
163	3	2	A sushi chef creating entrees of art that will have you talking as much as eating.
164	3	0	Mango ice cream or coffee-flavored gelatin finishes the flavorful journey.
165	3	2	Never will you taste sicilian Pizza and Spumoni like LBs.
166	3	2	One waiter came by and literally threw the $36 salad on the table.
167	3	2	Food was good, but for the price of a plate of pasta here, four raviolis doesn't cut it as an entre for a big guy.
168	3	1	Walked in on Chinese New Year Sunday late in the afternoon, around 5 or 6 -- seating was not a problem the dim sum was deliciously fresh -- very likely a by-product of their not using carts.
169	3	2	the waiter was extremely helpful, basically we gave him carte blanche to order small plates for us that he thought we'd like.
170	3	2	The Scene The windowed bar and front waiting area seems bright and airy compared to the somewhat stuffy main room.
171	3	0	The line moves quickly, perhaps because there are no alcoholic drinks, which cuts lingering at the tables to a minimum.
172	3	2	The service was only average - even with reservations we waited 40 minutes, and had to ask for our table, which had been ready, the hostess just never bothered to tell us.
173	3	2	The spacious bar, with its own menu of small plates and a lengthy list of wines by the glass, is a boon to single diners.
174	3	1	The choices for vegetarians are extremely limited, unless one is content with side dishes.
175	3	2	People at the next table were complaining how horrible their house wine was.
176	3	0	Reserve a cozy window seat for more privacy, or hop onto a stool at the bar to dine solo.
177	3	2	It wasn't until we spoke with management that we were able to finish our meal and get out of the restaurant, but already one of our party had to leave early and the rest of us were late for our afternoon engagements.
178	3	0	Nostalgic lodgey bric-a-brac adorns the livelier front dining room and bar, while the dim, non-smoking back room is decorated with stained glass and modern, Mission-style chairs.
179	3	1	though the portions were smaller than average, the flavor and sauces that accompany them (truffle honey, cherries and peaches in mustard sauce) were all really good.
180	3	1	The portions are not HUGE, but you are very full by the end of your meal.
181	3	2	I didn't know what to expect from Frankie and Johnnie's when I made the reservation after my friend told me it was the best steak he had had.
182	3	2	The atmosphere was nice in the front room, but despite a reservation, we were relegated to the rear, where we were treated like stepchildren - we had to flag someone down to take our order, water with no ice, we had to ask for extras (as opposed to someone asking if we needed something else).
183	3	0	But, quickly all would realize that most items on the menu are grease-laden, and the portions are so big that you'd get tired of the flavors before you finish half a plate.
184	3	0	The view is the reason to go to this restaurant, not the food nor the service.
185	3	1	My only gripe was that the food was all in big bins, but that's expected for a lunch rush hour type crowd.
186	3	1	Great wine list with an extra expensive selection for all you big spenders.
187	3	0	On top of that, the portions were hearty enough that we barely had any appetite left for dessert.
188	3	2	We were a party of six and I had tried almost everything that was on the table, and had I been rich I would have hired the chef to cook only for me!
189	3	2	The Scene  With flickering sconces and rough-hewn brick walls, Crispo may look like an elegantly restored Italian farmhouse, but frenzied servers, tight tables and wait-list hopefuls at the marble bar make it feel like a city-slick hotspot.
190	3	0	On each table there's a variety of sauces and spices, which you're encouraged to add to your dish; by the end of the meal you mind up with something completely different in your bowl from you started, but it will still be so satisfying.
191	3	0	The chef/owner is always walking around making sure everyone is having a good time.
192	3	2	Once the waitress cursed our table for not tipping enough after we had waited an hour to order and another half an hour just to get a drink, on top of this I had to find my own cutlery.
193	3	2	I had to physically get out of my seat and find the waitress twice just to ask for more water.
194	3	0	After a couple of drinks upstairs before our meal, we slipped downstairs to a nice corner table that offered plenty of privacy in this 'loud' place.
195	3	2	Chances are the garden out back is hopping, with happy Slopers sipping wines that start less than $20 per bottle and munching on more than a dozen kinds of pressed sandwiches.
196	3	2	Of course we went there with a large party and had to wait a bit to get seated (even with reservations), but we had all our dishes served at the same time and promptly.
197	3	2	The place is small, the host was friendly and communicative -- we had to wait 45 minutes for a table but they don't take reservations and clearly it's a popular spot.
198	3	2	when our server accidentally spilled some wine at our table, he cleaned it up offered us another glass right away.
199	3	2	Even though we complained several times, they brought us the bill before dessert and the manager came to our table to mention he was closing the place for the night.
200	3	2	While getting a reservation upstairs can be a pain, stopping by on Saturday night for a dinner by the window is a fun way to experience Babbo without the long term planning.
201	3	2	Upon explaining, the waiter confronted us as we left and spewed a stream of profanities at us as we walked out the door.
202	3	2	Setting aside the interminable wait for food, the cheese omelet opened up on the way from the kitchen to the table so that when it arrived, it looked like a large yellow pancake with a slab of uncooked cheese sitting in the middle.
203	3	0	the filet came out and was absolutely delicious, on a bed of julienned vegetables in a balsamic vinagarette sauce.
204	3	2	The Scene You'll have to knock to enter this hidden dining room, a luxe windowless space featuring four wall-sized murals depicting famous landmarks throughout the seasons, as well as a handful of finery-laden tables.
205	3	2	The owner promised my party a table and bottle service and took care of it immediately as we all arrived.
206	3	0	Went for restaurant week and surprisingly on the menu were entree options of Mahi, Mahi, Kobe Beef ribs, Salmon and some other things in very reasonable portions.
207	3	1	Portions were certainly substantial for lunch.
208	3	2	Not 5 minutes passed before the server actually tapped us on the shoulder and, I swear to god, ASKED US TO LEAVE because they had a reservation.
209	3	0	The Setting The exposed brick and tangerine walls, flickering candles and tiny bar cast a formal mood across this cozy Park Slope trattoria, but the high ceiling fans and two glass walls (left open in warm weather) add a casual breeziness.
210	3	0	If you are expecting big portions, go find a Cheesecake Factory.
211	3	1	Pastas include shellfish-stocked linguine with tomato sauce, and an excellent homemade cheese ravioli--all are available in half portions.
212	3	2	Watch out for the sesame noodles, though, and leave the complimentary pickled cabbage and carrots sitting on the table for the next customer to enjoy.
213	3	2	The menus took about 15 minutes to come, the menu were already set up for Valentines day the salad was good my dinner was a soup of about 2 or three shrimps, THAT'S IT!
214	3	1	Menu had several fish selections (snapper, salmon, cod) but all were around $30 despite the fact that the portions would hardly fill a child's belly and the sides were 3 pieces of lettuce (literally).
215	3	1	Particularly good is the chicken verde burrito with a refreshingly spicy salsa that avoids the heat overkill.
216	3	1	The food was pretty good but the portions were smaller than what I would expect for brunch.
217	3	2	While there's a strong Asian influence behind many of the plates, you can't pigeonhole the food into a single genre, as there are Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Italian and American dishes incorporated into this creative menu.
218	3	2	The hostess SLOWLY walked by our table scribbing something on paper.
219	3	1	Everything that could go wrong did starting with the set menu that I was not informed of at the time of the reservation, to trying to seat us 45 minutes late at a table that was not made up.
220	3	2	Our waiter never once came by the table to ask us how our meal was.
221	3	1	There is a bar right by the door, which is convenient while waiting in the long lines for a seat and be prepared to wait on the weekends.
222	3	2	As the waitress cleaned the table in a rush she knocked over a party bag containing a glass bottle with bath oil.
223	3	0	Those waiting inside to get a free table and waitresses carlessly walking by only served to make matters worse.
224	3	1	So maybe I'm naive to the latest trends in dining, but I really didn't like it.
225	3	2	The Scene The space, fit with imported giant urinals, zinc-topped bar, large antique mirrors, mosaic floor tiles and mahogany trim, looks like it's been around forever.
226	3	2	We then waited until 7:35 before any food arrived at our table, despite the fact that we kept reminding our waitress that we needed to leave by 7:45.
227	3	1	When the pizza arrived it was definitely hot, however the topping was rather soggy from the moisture from the fresh tomatoes.
228	3	2	The service is almost stifling polite (they pushed in my chair behind me every time I returned from the bathroom), though the sushi chef preparing my food was casual and chatty.
229	3	1	The green hair table and seating at the front window was tacky and gimmicky, but figured it's the food that counts.
230	3	2	Myself along with every other patron were forced to wait in an overcrowded bar while employees carry chairs and such over our heads to prepare for dinner in the next room, shoulder to shoulder we stood there like cattle waiting to be fed.
231	3	1	The Food The pan-Italian menu forgoes the appetizer-entree format in favor of fairly priced small plates, which quickly add up.
232	3	1	The food makes up for it, though the quality has fallen victim to it's success.
233	3	0	The Japanese folk music blaring on the quaint speakers are a trip and they have some interesting things on the menu like bull pen|s and turkey testicles.
234	3	2	The wait for a table is interminable.
235	3	2	but we waiting two hours to get it (we had reservations but it was late so we wanted to try to come in earlier).
236	3	2	the waitress was probably new, because she had no idea what wine they had, or if they had a certain type by the glass or bottle, and kept going back to the bar to find out.
237	3	1	The waitress recommended four courses, not three, given their tiny size.
238	3	2	I was a bit taken aback by the paper napkins and the flyer like menu, but was excited nevertheless to taste the food praised by at least 6 people on this site.
239	3	2	The place was empty except for one table, but they were just having drinks (red flag #1).
240	3	2	So, get drinks elsewhere, have a nice dinner here, and stop by the package store on the way home where you can get a bottle of Bombay Sapphire for the cost of 2 drinks here.
241	3	0	One person's dinner was cold, another was charged for a larger portion than ordered, and my shrimp pasta was inedible.
242	3	1	Babbo and Lupa are significantly better, and this place should redo the menu, or empty seats could become the norm.
243	3	2	We waited FOREVER on Valentine's Day for our table because their hostess had lost our reservation BUT the food was worthy of the long wait anyway.
244	3	0	Pad thai and a variety of noodle soups, such as pho bac and Bangkok Curry, round out the menu and arrive in heaping portions.
245	3	1	The portions are not huge, but they do include an alcoholic beverage or fresh juice, so that made up for it.
246	3	2	After ordering a couple beers from the pleasant bartender, my date and I took a seat at one of MANY vacant tables next to the bar (The bar stools were full).
247	3	2	NEED Reservations in order to get past the host by the secret door and the maitre d host downstairs but No trace of snooby attitude here.
248	3	2	Informal servers sashay past plastic chairs and patterned booths, ducking enormous lampshades with cheerful insouciance.
249	3	0	Besides ordering single dishes you can also order family style.
250	3	2	But my lunch was very light with a wrap, not tortilla, but something thinner, a rice paper sort of crepe, that had lettuce and spicy cabbage and thin sliced beef.
251	3	2	Those less interested in people-watching dine inside the whimsical, wood-trimmed room under a canopy of Italian inscriptions, or at the long, art-lined bar, which hosts a hopping after-work crowd.
252	3	2	We sat near the sluggish, hot and very loud kitchen and the service area was not wiped down once during the entire time.
253	3	0	Soy abounds, in all forms: as firm patties, pure squares of glistening tofu, and something called a hijiki patty--mixed tastily with shreds of seaweed, then fried.
254	3	2	If you think the prices are outrageous, just take the family, enjoy the ride and go in and order a few appetizers as prelude to a real dinner.
255	3	0	This restaurant was a great value, even though I know nothing about the prix fixe menu.
256	3	0	Down right comfortable, pleasant, enormous portions, have lunch and bring home a doggie bag wth your dinner.
257	3	2	The host actually came over to my table and told me and my date we had to leave because we already paid our bill.
258	3	0	Their Korean menu was also equally impressive, A must try is the Kimchee cabbage pancakes as an appetiser ( the portions were as big as an entree!)
259	3	2	The Waterview is one of the best diners I've evr been to interms of the quality and taste of the food.
260	3	2	This is one of two Ping's in Queens, the other one on Queens Blvd in Elmhurst serves great seafood dishes fished straight off clean tanks.
261	3	2	Unfortunately it gets very crowded on the weekends, so if you don't mind dining at the bar you can skip the wait for a table.
262	3	2	They spoon the FAT GREASE over your steak when they bring it to the table.
263	3	1	Count on fresh, fairly priced cuts of fish that represent a good value, even if portions are a bit on the small side.
264	3	2	Warming clam miso soup and expertly rolled Mexican maki (made with yellowtail, scallions, avocado, and jalapeno mayonnaise) pair well with a stiff glass of shochu, Japanese liquor with a bite as strong as tequila.
265	3	1	The food was cold and did not match the description on the menu, the waiter could not be bothered with me (and I am nice to deal with since I work in the industry), and it was way over priced.
266	3	1	00 bottle of wine, we had to endure the waiter's attitude, like he was doing us a solid, if you're into huge Euro crowds and don't care about what you eat and how it is served to you, Baraonda is your kind of place.
267	3	2	We had to wait by the door, and the host failed to acknowledge our existence for a whole 15 minutes!
268	3	2	Sit at the bar (no reservations necessary), eat, talk to the bartender, and enjoy, b/c come dinnertime you will pay quadruple the price (but it's still worth it).
269	3	2	Once at the table our waitress managed on two occasions to take 15 minutes bringing drinks to our table, our plates sat uncleared on the table for just as long.
270	3	2	We had reserved space one one side of the bar, but when the staff tried to force the Pre-Fixe on all 15 members of the party to stay there, we moved to the other side (the difference in decor was minimal).
271	3	2	We had a horrible night here stemming from intolerable service, no appologies after our food never came out after waiting longer than an hour and a half, and a plate of crusty bread thrown at us when we asked for their signature corn bread.
272	3	2	The Scene Vintage suitcases and black-and-white photos of old ocean liners evoke the Golden Age of travel in the front bar, where a worldly clientele sips cocktails around a flickering faux fireplace.
273	3	2	We had reservations and when we showed up the manager told us the wait was over 45 mins.
274	3	2	Diners choose between deep banquettes or seats at the bar, which offer a front-row view of the small preparation area and a chance to watch the two chefs as they whip together the elegantly constructed desserts.
275	3	2	The waiter poured our wine into my water glass, rolled his eyes when I asked for a new water, and definitely didn't offer to comp the wasted glass of wine.
276	3	2	I can't imagine waiting for 20 minutes to have my plates removed, given that usually the waitstaff hover around like birds of prey waiting for a fork to drop etc.
277	3	2	Oh, but on a brighter note, when the waiter poured water into my vodka glass by mistake, we got a free drink out of it.
278	3	0	Went to dinner with some girlfriends on Wednesday at Calico Jacks and had a fun time.
279	3	0	You'd expect one to have more dessert options, other than rice pudding.
280	3	1	The waiter's knowledge of the menu and ability to make recommendations were ridiculously bad, requests weren't observed effectively, and our water and wine glasses were not kept full.
281	3	2	Despite the fact that I had called earlier in the day and was told that the place didn't take reservations and there were several empty tables for two on both floors, we were told that there would be a 30 minute wait.
282	3	2	There are a few things I can forgive at any popular place: somewhat long waits even with reservations, service staff that mistakenly believes they're there to act haughty rather than serve, and a way over-the-top interior.
283	3	2	Inside as we waited momentarily for our table, the bartender made light conversation as he made our drinks.
284	3	2	Tuesdays are Wine Lovers nights, where everything on their wine list is half off - it's a great deal.
285	3	0	This Prospect Heights institution, with its old-fashioned soda-fountain type counter, complete with cakes of the day on pedastals w glass covers, attracts a diverse and loyal crowd.
286	3	1	The host was playing god with his headset and reservation list, the bar was packed with horney drunken investment bankers, reservations are a joke and after haplessly sliding the plates at us when serving the food, they couldn't wait to collect the plates until we were done.
287	3	2	A blink-and-you-missed, tiny bar lines the lefthand side wall as you enter, which is packed with neighborhood hipsters, but it sadly interferes with the tables filled with dining patrons that are forking out mega bucks for mediocre fare.
288	3	2	We ate at the bar to avoid waiting for a table.
289	3	0	It was absolutely delicious to the point where i went back and asked for a variety plate They were so nice to accomodate me and gave me almost everything on the menu to taste from.
290	3	2	After waiting over a month for weekend reservations, I would of rather gone to IL Baggato.
291	3	2	The Scene There are exactly three small tables at this tiny hole in the wall, but for food lovers on a budget, it's heaven.
292	3	2	We did not have reservations so we sat at the small bar with the friendly bartender for 10 minutes.
293	3	2	We often come with a baby and the staff is so sweet and kind to her, it is a joy to be there.
294	3	2	First, the seating people gave me huge attitude and claimed I had not reserved a table at the grotto - and I quote my reservation You are all set for the grotta this saturday.
295	3	1	the sushi was good and the service was not as bad as some would have you think but the crowd was more business than hip, more wall st.
296	3	1	The salad looked as though they have a premixed trash bag full of it, and they just dump a heap of it on a plate.
297	3	1	The crowd is not young, but hey, go somewhere else to get a drink afterward.
298	3	2	I arrived with one other person at ~8:30 on a Wed night -- the hostess was very kind and showed me the reservation computer which showed that they were completely booked.
299	3	2	Well, literally 7 minutes later we were being served dinner, with no apologies from the server who was too scared to come to our table.
300	3	2	We had a late 9:30 pm reservation; when we arrived and went to be seated, there was some type of discrepancy since the hostess was missing in action.
301	3	0	Appetizers took their sweet time in coming, and literally about an hour later we had our main dishes which were very small considering the price.
302	3	1	From the enormous menu, we opted for the 3-course dinner specials - chicken soup or clam chowder, although small portions, came with loads of rolls, crackers etc.
303	3	1	Tension filled the air as the chief yelled at a waiter in the middle of the bar while in uniform and drinking.
304	3	2	Midway through the meal the waiter came over and said we were being charged $40 a head since there were 7 of us, and they never said that when i made the reservation.
305	3	0	I organized a dinner for 20 and was extremely satisfied with the results.
306	3	2	The only cuisines that will provide comparable quality in the vicinity are Greek (if you know where to look) and Pizza.
307	3	0	The other two entrees that were ordered were very large portions.
308	3	2	We were served by two very rude waitresses who slammed every glass and dish they brought onto the table, and then got so caught up by hanging out at the bar that I eventually had to hunt them down to pay my bill.
309	3	2	Upon arrival I attempted to give a waiter my name (there doesn't seem to be a hostess) and tell him I had a 9pm reservation, but was told to just go get in line and wait for a table.
310	3	2	The space is small and reservations are definitly needed.
311	3	2	Had to constantly ask the waiter to top up water glasses, but generally service was ok.
312	3	2	Ones experience is truly dampened by having to trundle up lifts and escalators, further on arrival at the restaurant we found the actual dining room to be slightly sterile and lacking in atmosphere.
313	3	1	I am not one to waste dessert but we threw away the box after taking a few bites of it.
314	3	0	The food wasn't impressive either- I was expecting huge portions, but my lobster ravioli was only 4 medium sized pieces, and I've tasted better at other restaurants.
315	3	2	When the other half of my party arrived, the waited helped us with the menu, and i was happy to know you can mix and match items in their lunch box I got the mekong box and i could not believe how great the pork sandwich was, I also enjoyed the asian salad and brownie tremendously.
316	3	2	The Scene Upstairs in a narrow, handsome but oddly shaped space, this serene, refined restaurant caters to a mostly business-oriented crowd that, auspiciously one presumes, is predominantly Japanese.
317	3	0	Good value for breakfast.
318	3	2	However, unlike a lot of places the service was great: we walked in after not being able to get a reservation and were seated within 10 mins.
319	3	2	From the bottomless cup of coffee to the basket o' scones mini-muffins to the delicious entrees, Dizzy's is the place to be.
320	3	2	Be prepared to make friends with the people sitting next to you, tight seating.
321	3	1	Although the food was in small portions, it was good.
322	3	2	Service was at best distracted, at worst disdainful, even though we came early with a reservation and are not food novices.
323	3	1	Though the celery root soup was super yummy - everything else was an overpriced letdown- the plates come out looking like it's the depression era.
324	3	2	I ordered the plane no fuss SALMON and it was honestly the best salmon EVER.
325	3	2	The wait staff are friendly, but they disappear after they take initial drink and food order.
326	3	1	Everyone says that their round slice is no good, but the Sicilian is so good that I have never tried the round.
327	3	0	I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
328	3	1	Even though the place was more than half empty he refused to do so because we had already given our order to the waiter and a change of tables would cause too much confusion.
329	3	2	They kept us waiting for more than an hour WITH a reservation and WITHOUT an apology.
330	3	2	An Egg like custard appetizer, a platter of different kinds of rolls made from: Lobster, Eel, Sword Fish, Trout, Blue Fin Tuna, Horse Mackerel, and Salmon Roe.
331	3	0	The Scene With three outposts around town, Sarabeth's Kitchen has become a well-known and reliable spot for casual dining at breakfast, lunch or dinner.
332	3	2	The prices are decent for this type of food and dining experience.
333	3	2	Their relatively recent introduction of a version of the Sicilian pie is called the Grandma pie featuring a thin crust, much sauce, with less cheese, and chopped Basil.
334	3	1	Whatever happen to FAMILY STYLE Thai cooking, the portion are too small and tradtional thai cooking uses MSG which I prefer not to have in my body.
335	3	2	If you don't want to wait 45 minutes for a table or a long time for service then don't go @ 9pm on a Friday or Saturday night.
336	3	1	Plus, everything comes in small to average portions, so the next time you get a sushi craving, I don't recommend that you go here.
337	3	2	We had a 9:30pm reservation for two which stretched out to an hour wait.
338	3	1	If only they'd get a better wine list - the reds are all so mediocre - this would be the perfect meal.
339	3	0	Special touch -- my dessert plate had Happy Birthday drizzled in chocolate.
340	3	2	The service isn't fantastic and the seating is a bit tight but if you aren't looking Four Seasons type quality, then this is the perfect spot to meet some friends for dinner or lunch.
341	3	0	This is the perfect spot to meet up with friends and have a drink at the bar or stay a while and enjoy the scene and savor the food.
342	3	2	The arrogant maitre'd was annoyed when i asked about sitting down those tables are for other reservations low and behold those tables were still open as my wife and I finished dinner.
343	3	0	Knock off 15-20% of the prices and you have a decent night out.
344	3	0	I liked the hummos platter, the brie sandwich, and about 20 other things on the menu (if they still have the chocolate cake you need to get it).
345	3	1	It's in a less travelled spot on 3rd, but the intimate setting is great and romantic.
346	3	1	It's a good place to meet up with a friend while shopping, grab lunch (although the lines do get long), dining solo, or to take home after work.
347	3	0	It came with a (small) salad, large bowl of udon, and 6 pieces of sushi plus wrapped rice (not sure what that was called.
348	3	2	best chicken in queens.
349	3	2	Reservations for parties under 5 people isn't allowed but their yummy cocktails and handsome waiters help soothe the pain.
350	3	2	A bustling crew of sage green-shirted servers whisk plates of luncheon and light dinner favorites to power lunchers, tourists, and ladies who lunch.
351	3	2	When one purchases a bottle of wine, it's fairly common practice for a server to come by and refill your glass, but not the case here; 2.
352	3	0	Increedible value, 3 courses $20 price fixe(menu changes everyday), organic seldom seen wines all around $20.
353	3	0	Perhaps it was because the 20% tip was already added to the bill, but the waiter brought us plain gazpacho without any of the other ingredients described on the menu; later, when we complained, he brought us saucers of garnish instead of new bowls of the soup properly prepared.
354	3	2	The host came by and told us that they made a mistake and would have to seat us at a two-person table.
355	3	0	Music is a nice mix of everything from Aerosmith to James Brown to Metallica to disco to whatever else there is.
356	3	2	Our waiter (the one with the Spanish accent) was a bit pre-occupied with other things- hardly coming around to the table and nowhere to be seen most of the time.
357	3	0	Worth the trip over the bridge, worth the search for parking, worth the wait for a table at dinner time and worthy of a ten rating.
358	3	2	A simple dish like Fattouch or Tabbouleh are turned into the most delicious salad youll ever have.
359	3	2	Since I listened closely, I know they were a party of 2 without any reservation The manager then offered to seat us but we left.
360	3	2	Unless you like getting bumped by waiters and people walking by, do not sit at a middle table.
361	3	1	The kitchen is fast, but you sometime may have trouble getting a seat, since this place is very small.
362	3	0	The outdoor tables overlooking bucolic Irving Place, or the wooden ones inside, are prime spots for brunch featuring all the usual suspects--omelets, pancakes, French toast--served on cast iron skillets and griddles.
363	3	0	With the large crowds here and the larger menu, be prepared to wait for your dinner to arrive at your table.
364	3	2	Well I can't tell you how the food was because the moment we walked in, the single waiter was extremely rude and told us to wait outside while he cleared a table (in the middle of winter) because he was busy.
365	3	0	junk food place that could do well with a good cleaning.
366	3	1	And while a narrow wood counter and three stools provide desperation seating, most folks choose to take lunch and dinner to go.
367	3	2	All-night restaurant with excellent burgers and stella on tap.
368	3	0	it's a very chill spot to hang with a group, I went there with a bunch of my friends to have drinks for my birthday and we all had a great time.
369	3	1	The upside of the smallish portions is that a good sake can do a better job working over one's date, and you don't leave the table w/ a food coma.
370	3	2	I don't claim that the place as the most authentic, but when you're talking about Southeast Asian street food, which really represents a melting pot of cultures and have slight variation in style for many similarly-named dishes depending where yuo're specifically from, who's to claim what's authentic?
371	3	1	Amarin's food is always fresh, although the quality does vary--avoid ordering on Friday Saturday nights, prime dining hours, when they seem to throw things togehter a little too haphazardly.
372	3	1	not fancy I think they keep their christmas decorations up all year long, but good mexican food!!
373	3	2	She's watching your table, helping the staff candy to your eyes.
374	3	2	I would definitely recommend getting reservations as the wait can be very long.
375	3	2	Once seated the waiter took our drink orders only to return 10 minutes later with the wrong drinks.
376	3	0	On each of my several visits, the crowd is local, professional, family and those who are not familiar with the cuisines of India are deftly walked through the menu by management.
377	3	0	The huge terrace is just so beautiful--and rumor has it they'll be tenting the space this fall, so we midtowners can continue to dine outside through the end of the year.
378	3	2	This much heralded restaurant brought my wife and I some excitement as we walked in the door, but we were met with an awkward maitre'd who barely spoke to us at all and just seemed standoff-ish.
379	3	1	When I saw it on the menu I didn't beleive it and was not expecting the real thing.
380	3	0	even when they informed us they were out of the port we chose to accompany our dessert, the manager made sure that we were offered an even better bottle that wasn't even featured on the menu.
381	3	2	Anyway we get a table and order some appetizers from one of the waitresses who was pleasently nice.
382	3	0	If it was outstanding I could see it as a nice change for lunch, but the peanut butter wasn't any better than one you could buy at any grocery store and the chocolate peanut butter brownie was horrible.
383	3	0	It's served cold with carmelized onions atop, with mashed potatoes on the side and it's the best darn thing this side of the Hudson.
384	3	2	Be prepared to wait for a table - go to the upstairs bar and crack open a bottle of wine, or a nice bottle of Italian beer, and get to know everyone else waiting - who knows, you could be sitting with them for dinner!
385	3	1	You may as well just extend the bar into the restaurant since it has already penetrated it with loud music, loud voices, and a remarkable amount of cigarette smoke.
386	3	1	It says it on the menu and the servers explain it to you as soon as you sit down so I'm surprised by how many people on this site complain about the portion sizes.
387	3	2	Outside the realm of steak, things aren't so certain: The pork chops can be a bit tough, lobster tails aren't the greatest and the special salad isn't.
388	3	2	of course i haven't mentioned the fact that we walked in on time for our reservation only to wait in the empty bar for over half an hour, being seated when we reminded the hostess that we were still waiting.
389	3	2	Don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining.
390	3	0	The Food The key element to a proper British chip is fat, and the flabby, pale yellow specimens here come close to the ideal.
391	3	0	The menu is a bit different and all of the selections are pretty tasty.
392	3	0	Basically traditional menu could have been boring and old-fashioned, but is instead updated enough to please modern palate: steaks, seafood, fish, poultry - ample portions (we took half home), seasoned with care and imagination.
393	3	2	My boyfriend took me to dinner for an early Valentine's Day, we showed up early for our reservation to meet an incredibly rude host who told us the bar was full, to just wait behind a rope.
394	3	1	Really great thin crust pizza - hot and fresh and fast, though you'll probably have to wait for a table.
395	3	1	Granted, it's loud and sometimes obnoxious and it's such a pain to get seats for, but the the food is great.
396	3	1	Love the pizza here (although the slices aren't as fresh at 3am, but who's that picky when you're drunk), and there's plenty of other good stuff.
397	3	1	We went ot Al di La a bit earlier than we usually go to dinner, mainly due to the fact that reservations are not accepted.
398	3	0	With a chef from Liguria, Italy, authentic Neapolitan brick oven pizza and one of the most impressive Italian wine lists I've ever seen, this was the real deal!
399	3	2	When we got there (6 women), we were not even allowed in when a staff member with a bad attitude wearing a suit told us that we absolutely needed a reservation (yes, we've gone from an artsy community to this)!
400	3	2	If you hate waiting for a table, then get take-out just around the corner next door.
401	3	0	Bouley has done an excellent job creating this dining establishment with almost a museum sense, the artworks on the wall have a very Klimty feeling and the gold ceiling completes the rest of the experience.
402	3	0	Coffee, treats, and the best of eerything.
403	3	0	The scene was sassy and cool, but i would never eat dinner here again.
404	3	2	The managers aren't snobby for wanting reservations -- it's a new restaurant and they're trying to manage the flow of diners.
405	3	1	They do have a large menu of things along the diner lines, and they go a little gourmet on the brunch omelette fixins/combos.
406	3	2	Despite reservations, we ended up waiting for 1hr+
407	3	2	We waited 15 minutes for a menu, another 20 for a tea, another 15 for an appetizer, then when the plates came out, the waitress had to ask me what I'd ordered.
408	3	2	My boyfriend and I went one Friday night to find that the place was empty except for one other table.
409	3	2	The Pink Pony's brunch is among the very best in the city!
410	3	2	The environment is a touch loud (although the music's good), but the walls sport nifty vintage items, from license plates to pennants to movie posters.
411	3	0	Fresh fish, tender milk fed veal and outrageous Veal Chops adorn their menu and special list.
412	3	2	Expect to stand around for a while before one of the waiters desides that they can be bothered to actually get you to a seat.
413	3	2	The staff were rude and rushed us through our meal, clearing plates and laying down dessert menus while others were still eating their main courses.
414	3	2	The place wasn't packed, but there was a bar scene and a few salsa dancers who strutted their stuff on the dancefloor.
415	3	2	Half way through the meal we did not have refills on our waters, even though our waiter passed the table many times and he never stopped to check on us or to ask if we were pleased with the entrees.
416	3	1	Besides, they used to be much more accommodating when I used to request a jalebi paratha instad of a plain naan as part of the brunch price.
417	3	2	A cold reception got even colder when we didn't have a reservation for a Tuesday night (the place was half empty).
418	3	0	The Scene Petite Abeille is ideal for a lazy lunch, a restorative brunch or light dinner.
419	3	2	The Scene Quartino's airy dining room, wrapped in high windows, hinges around a trendy bar where regulars sip wine out of blunt tumblers while swapping stories--often in Italian.
420	3	1	We were directed to a table by a member of staff, which we were then informed was reserved, and lost our seats at the bar, all this after spending upwards of $30 each on very expensive drinks over a two-hour period.
421	3	0	Good Italian spot, but should raise the bar on the food before some newcomers challenge its standings.
422	3	0	went here late night after a a few drinks at my favorite watering spot and was amazed that a place which serves food till 4 can be so damned good.
423	3	2	What do you like more, completely addictive patties of greasy beef, or glasses of cheap refreshing beer to wash it down?
424	3	2	Yet, the place was emptyIts too bad because the food is authentic and price is very reasonable considering the location and the quality (eg.
425	3	0	the heroes are enough for lunch and dinner.
426	3	1	While the appetizers, entrees, and desserts arrived in a timely manner, our water glasses maintained consistently empty (at one point one of us had to ask for water twice!)
427	3	2	We were first greeted by a very friendly hostess who asked if we had reservations - even though we didn't they were VERY accommodating - we sat at the bar and spoke to the VERY nice bartender who recommended a GREAT wine and gave us some brucetta to munch on while we waited.
428	3	2	Wait staff is seemingly non-existant, and food servers are way too agressive - our food was thrown on the table, and even knocked a member of my party in the head with a plate with little acknowledgement.
429	3	2	I had reservations for 9:30pm and after waiting more that 50 mins and bunch of lies that you're next.
430	3	1	Corner Bistro, despite the hoopla and critical praise, is nothing more than a burger joint with long lines.
431	3	2	Despite almost flawless service, I had my birthday there for a party of 15 and we were given a private area on the top floor, which was so cold, we had to keep our jackets on throughout the entire meal.
432	3	0	The Food Mi Nidito's menu offers a considerable array of Mexican standards, with a separate page for seafood, such as King crab enchiladas, and another for vegetarian dishes such as almond-sauteed vegetables.
433	3	0	After finally choosing banana-macadamia nut pancakes (a Hawaiian favorite of mine) after being unable to decide between 4 or 5 dishes that all sounded spectacular, I sat back and enjoyed the (complementary) tall shot glass of the smoothie of the day.
434	3	2	and although the service is a little slow, the lax atmosphere allows you to drink and eat away the afternoon or evening and not even care.
435	3	1	Although Sweet Melissa's food and pastries are very tasty, the unfriendly folks who work there sour the experience.
436	3	0	from drinks at the bar, to our perfect round table!
437	3	2	To complain about waiting for a table, etc.
438	3	0	Unlike some of the other reviews here, the reservation was upheld, the waiter took the time to explain each dish and frequently asked if we wanted more of anything (which we did, several times).
439	3	1	Anyway the food was really good, the portions are not big however very filling and exceptionally good.
440	3	2	After arriving an hour early for our reservation for 2 and politely asking for a table near the band we were promptly seated at one of the worst tables in the place.
441	3	1	I found my dinner to be a bit on the heavy side and blamed the large portions.
442	3	2	I made a reservation on-line quickly got a call saying that the resturant was under renovation, but the kitchen was still open and was still more than welcome to come enjoy dinner in their lounge.
443	3	0	Once in the oven (electric, mind you), he shifts pies every few seconds to attain nicely-charred, chewy crust perfection.
444	3	1	cause, I was bored by the club scene and too overdressed for the local bar.
445	3	2	After 10 minutes of waiting, he finally returned to the table and snootily explained to us that the wine he had opened was actually better and more expensive (not yet on the menu, of course), but he would charge us the price of the bottle we had originally ordered.
446	3	2	Hoegardden on tap is an added bonus if you're not drinking from the well versed wine menu.
447	3	0	When we followed the waiter to get back the card, the Manager explained that their machine did work, but someone else's bill was charged on our card (total charge=$140).
448	3	2	Even with reservations, checking in, and a generally quiet night, the hostess forgot that we were there and gave our table to her friends.
449	3	2	Fresh, original, creative, absolutely delicious - Perhaps I would chose a table at this cozy Italian corner versus an NYC top 5?
450	3	0	My experience at the The Pearl Room was like no other place in Bay Ridge, you walk into a dimly lit atomsphere and a well dressed crowd.
451	3	1	The atmosphere was a+, until a friend and I were rudely interrrupted and rushed out by the attendant at the door when the check was only returned to us just 5 mins.
452	3	2	I had to ask the waiter a couple of times to clear our empty glasses.
453	3	1	Go have a drink there the space is beautiful and buy an appetizer maybe, but pass on dinner, not well cooked and small portions.
454	3	1	When you feel like eating again an hour later (portions are small) at least you won't feel as regretful about ordering take-out.
455	3	2	This is a don't miss if you are anywhere close to the area, but if you're going for lunch, be there by noon to avoid a wait.
456	3	1	We had to wait 20 minutes before getting a beer, and we never got our burger order.
457	3	2	The menu had more selections, price points that fit all our budgets and a new Sushi menu that went over huge with the table.
458	3	0	Dim, candlelit dining room is accented by a funky star pointed bar and multi-colored ceiling lamps, with trendy upbeat music in the background.
459	3	2	$45 a head with tip for bad gnocchi, mediocre wine (as recommended by a condescending waiter, who thought himself oh-so-nice) and the feeling that our companions (at our shared table) were listening in on all our chatter.
460	3	2	Luckily, I made reservations for our group or else it would have been a long wait.
461	3	1	I went for dinner at Lucy the other night with five friends and it was the best experience I've had in a long time.
462	3	2	Didn't get a call so I thought all was ok-they didn't have a reservation and wouldn't seat us for over an hour even though no one else was waiting and I saw several empty tables.
463	3	2	When we were finally seated about half an hour after my reservation, the waitress took her time taking our order.
464	3	2	The only apparent flavor in any of the dishes was heat, and a table of four gourmands left at least half of our meals on our plates.
465	3	1	The portions are like a buffett for breakfast.
466	3	1	Dinner is okay - not many vegetarian options, and the portions are small.
467	3	2	I had to try the sweet tea, which was served in a plastic cup at room temperture.
468	3	2	I can only say that the soup dumplings are almost as good as Joe's Shanghai and some dishes I had (like Eight Spice appetizer) were tasty while others (Shanghai style Shumai) were less so.
469	3	2	We were a large group and would highly recommend all the drinks and foodThe manager on duty was understanding that our friends were very late and held our reservation.
470	3	2	The menu contains both Japanese fusion and plain Italian dishes - everyone should be able to find something they like.
471	3	2	The Scene The consistent lines at this bustling Japanese tapas hot spot don't lie: Yokocho's fresh, reasonably priced comfort food and social atmosphere draw a youthful clientele of cultural natives and gaijin alike.
472	3	2	There are times when there is a long wait at lunch so be safe and make a reservation.
473	3	2	not only were we waiting for half an hour with reservations, once we got seated we waited another 15+ minutes for the waiter to come and take out drink menu.
474	3	1	I'm not going to trash the place simply because I had a bad experience there, but here's the facts: the food is very good, the portions are small-to-medium, and the prices are large.
475	3	2	Called to make a reservation and b/c the man who answered was so nice decided to chance it.
476	3	2	Cheese on the bottom, sauce on top - not too thick or doughy.
477	3	0	I went for lunch yesterday and had a lovely time.
478	3	0	Don't expect trendy atmosphere: room looks like it could have been designed in 1940s, but who cares - it's actually comfortable and inviting; with great food and unbeatable value, you can't go wrong.
479	3	2	After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.
480	3	2	The waiter was conspicuously eyeing our table the entire meal and there was a lot of scurrying by the wait staff in general.
481	3	2	AND, the waitstaff likes to lick its fingers when cutting cakes/pies and serves hot and cold drinks by holding the glass or cup around the brim/top.
482	3	2	It's very reasonably priced considering the size of portions.
483	3	2	Its not cheap, it was $10 for a burger and fries, and when i was there, the waiter had dropped a FULL glass of coke on a patron, soaking her through!
484	3	2	The specials of the day are the way to go.
485	3	1	The food was very good but the portions are pretty small, so while the prices are low, the place is not quite a bargain it seems to be.
486	3	2	They lost our reservations and the manager quickly came over and apologized and then gave us a free round of drinks and free dessert.
487	3	0	For the price you pay, you get good quality and deliciously thin sliced beef.
488	3	2	The Scene Cooing couples find some formality and open air up in the front room, while the subterranean back area offers hunkered-down seating for loungier dining.
489	3	1	The food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including dessert.
490	3	0	I had the lentils and cous cous for lunch the next day because my friend and I had appetizers before our entrees-- portions are pretty decent for the price, and tasty to boot.
491	3	0	At least you have the ambiance and lovely live piano musice being played for you while you wait.
492	3	2	Our meal was capped of with the waiter rudely saying he needed the table for other customers.
493	3	0	The music was a bit loud but the song selection was great, so we blew off desert and had another round of drinks at the bar.
494	3	2	Heartland is the best place in mid-town to grab a beer after work and meet the cuties that work in the building.
495	3	1	The service was nice, although our food took longer than usual to arrive because it had been brought to the wrong table and accidently eaten.
496	3	1	The food was very good but portions were small.
497	3	2	I prefer to sit at the bar as I don't have to listen to loud, boring conversations from the next table who always seem to be friends of the owner.
498	3	0	The food was delicious, and the menu provided ample choices which suited all of the eaters in our party from the most daring to the most conservative.
499	3	2	My nice waitress even came running out of the restaurant to hand me a tiny box I had forgotten on the table.
500	3	2	While waiting for a table, tried to get a drink from a bartender who seemed more interested in arguing with his waiters.
501	3	0	warm orangey glow, nice old mexican prints, wee bar that my bf and i vowed to go back and linger at.
502	3	2	We were coldly greeted by a hostess and wait staff who, in spite of our reservation, did not want to seat any of us, including the elderly, until our entire party had arrived.
503	3	1	Our meals were a moderate portion and they weren't too spicy.
504	3	1	The place was a bit noisy, but sitting on the edge of the restaurant helped, and although the portions were small, w/ an appetizer it was the perfect amount of food.
505	3	1	Although the sushi was fresh, I was disappointed with the size of the portions for the price.
506	3	2	When I asked to speak to a manager, I was sent to voicemail, and I still haven't received a callback.
507	3	2	Our waiter was pretty much non-existent and when he did come to our table he practically tossed our plates and wine glasses in front of us.
508	3	0	The atmosphere was so fun that we decided to have another cocktail at the bar and enjoy the scene.
509	3	2	I came in for brunch with my parents on Saturday and the place was packed.
510	3	0	This is definitely a special occasion spot, unless you don't mind a hefty bill, but rest assured that either way, it's well worth it.
511	3	2	Went early with reservation, place was empty, and they squeezed our two top in between other diners at a banquette.
512	3	2	Food and service were very good but prices were a bit high for the portions.
513	3	0	I used to live in Japan, and have had some pretty good raw fish, but I was blown away by the Chef's tasting plate, which includes 6 appetizers including a stunning octopus portion and some incredible sashimi.
514	3	0	I liked the place and the people, but we really went to have dinner no appetizers as the whole dinner.
515	3	2	While the hostess claimed to have lost my reservation, we were there early enough to only have to wait about 10 minutes to seat our party of seven.
516	3	1	When the food arrived, the portions were really small, and didn't really reflect the awesome descriptions on the menu.
517	3	1	Only problem was - an older gentleman (well-dressed but a little enebriated) chose to sit down right next to me - despite the fact that all 15 other seats were free - order himself a martini, and then describe how dry and dissapointing the burger was when he ordered it a few days ago.
518	3	0	The bar has a large selection of beers on tap,bottles or cans.
519	3	1	Waited 30 min for a brick they call bread and water, another hour for food (tiiiiiiiny portions).
520	3	2	We had to flag down the waiter even to refill water glasses!
521	3	0	Granted we were just the girls, but this would also be a great date spot b/c the ambiance is chic and bustling yet you can also hear the conversation at your own table rather than a loud din or worse, someone else's conversation.
522	3	0	The portions are big so you can split an appetizer.
523	3	0	I've never been able to find a lunch place in the midtown with the same quality and service, until now.
524	3	2	It was worth the wait , an hour, without a reservation, for an out of this world meal.
525	3	0	Order the porterhouse and they put it between you and you kind of eat family style at a wooden table.
526	3	0	The bar gets out of control busy due to it's proximity to Fordham University--but the Fordham kids are cool, so it's alright!
527	3	2	Comfort standbys--including bacon-wrapped meat loaf and barbecued ribs, and upscaled interpretations--like tuna club made with wasabi mayo, share space with brunch favorites (Belgian waffles, fluffy buttermilk pancakes and wrecked eggs, or tofu).
528	3	1	I write that in quotes becuase iceberg lettuce, stale Pepperidge Farm croutons and bottled dressing does not a salad make.
529	3	1	This was followed by various wacky hijinks: overly sweet foie de gras, lack of extra ginger/soy sauce, minute portions even for sushi, appetizers arriving at different times.
530	3	2	Waiter suggests a beer, and offers to bring a small glass, to taste it and see if I like it, before I even order the beer!
531	3	0	And the room is VERY noisy, but I suppose that's because everyone is having a good time.
532	3	2	perhaps the place is better after the theatre crowd is gone but we were in the midst of it and it wasn't a very enjoyable experience.
533	3	2	The Scene You won't blink twice at the restaurant's spartan decor: As the packed crowds and critics' praises wallpapering the front wall agree, this longtime local favorite is truly one of the area's most exquisite finds.
534	3	2	The service has always been outstanding and even when we didn't have a reservation they worked something out, where I agreed to keep our meal to just eating.
535	3	2	To start with - the maitre'd forgot our reservation and then when it came time to sit us down - he told us we only had an hour.
536	3	0	The table next to us recommended that share because the portions are big(we split two entrees)The food was so good I wish that there was some left over to take home for the next day.
537	3	2	Our waiter had started to circle around our table like a shark after our 2nd dish, taking out plates when we were not even done.
538	3	2	My reservation for 2 was during lunch and it seemed that because I was literally 2 minutes late, the hostess felt the need to seat every party before mine.
539	3	2	Went the next day for lunch - menu too pricey for lunch and the waiter was the WORST !!
540	3	0	Al Di La serves up an impressive selection of options ranging from meditarranean fish to rabbit to to duck to pasta.
541	3	2	when someone from our table of 5 asked the waitress for refill on water, she comes back and fills only that person's glass, leaving the rest of the table with almost empty glasses.
542	3	1	The food is decent, but WAY TOO SMALL of portions for what you pay for.
543	3	2	Watch out for the overworked, stressed out waitress who dumps tapa dishes on the table and leaves w/out announcing what it is.
544	3	2	On the table you will also find individual bottles of fine imported olive oil which we put on the bread-fantastic!
545	3	2	Then the staff behind the buffett just haven't gotten their groove yet, so you order your food and wait five minutes while it sits behind the glass on a plate, getting cold.
546	3	1	It took forever to seat us even though the restaurant was almost completely empty, then we had to ask to be waited on, it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks, and then another 30 minutes to get our salad and then even more time to get our pizza and then our bill.
547	3	0	As expected, the beer selection is perfectly in synch with the menu.
548	3	2	The House salad is big enough to split, The Fried Calamari is some of the best I ever ate, the bowties broccoli, broccoli rabe, square slices, broiled filet of sole, clam sauce.
549	3	2	The only problem my party found was that when people asked for knives and forks (there were only chopsticks on the table) the waitress laughed at them.
550	3	2	I have a litany of complaints -- being over-charged for wine that I didn't order, shady waiters, so-so food that arrived at the table luke warm, main course portion sizes barely large enough to be appetizer sizes, lack of fabulosity that Mr.
551	3	2	The wait staff was better the second time around and our water glasses were always full.
552	3	2	I highly suggest you make reservations, as wait times can be extremely long.
553	3	1	You must think that the quality is poor for them to sell it for such a low price.
554	3	0	The Food Consulting Chef Douglas Rodriguez's forte is blending the diversity of traditional Latin cuisine with modern culinary chic: A celery sorbet cools the spicy-citrus bite of lobster; shrimp seviche and crunchy green plantains coat thick, juicy halibut resting on sweet plantain hash; and tart tomato escabeche moistens a chewy skirt steak.
555	3	2	The waiters are nice, but weren't particularly good - waited forever to order and resented not being told that my dinner companion and I had ordered enough for a table of 10 (given the size of the sushi).
556	3	2	The Scene Less trendy than Plan Eat Thailand, less crowded than Veracruz and infinitely more charming is Bean, a Mexican spot on Bedford Avenue's college-town-like stretch.
557	3	0	The Food A good way to judge a Thai spot is by its green curry: The all-Thai staff here fashions it spicy and smooth, filled to bursting with meat and thin-sliced bamboo shoots.
558	3	0	The kitchen turns out a long list of American bar food staples, like burgers and fries.
559	3	2	When I went back to the hostess (yes it was past the time we had for our original reservation) - she said that it was fine to get seated but we needed to leave in an hour.
560	3	1	The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
561	3	2	This is one of my first dining experiences in NYC when I first moved here 10 years ago, and although Hudson Corner is consistently good, it has gone downhill over the years in both food quality and service!
562	3	2	We made a reservation for 5:30pm (20 people) and people were still arriving at 5:45 (over half the group was there) when the manager came over and literally yelled at us for not being on time saying it was a busy time for him, when in fact there were several empty tables throughout the restaurant.
563	3	2	The Crystal Ballroom was closed for a private party, so we couldn't even enjoy the decor.
564	3	2	The waiter kept coming up and asking to take our plates while we were still eating and the manager stood and stared at us through half our meal!
565	3	0	The restaurant was recently taken over by new managment and, having eaten there under the prior management, I can say that the quality of the dishes has improved.
566	3	2	The steaks are just as good, with an assortment of tasty side dishes that make Peter Luger's menu look like the slip in a fortune cookie.
567	3	0	Theme and actors are kinda cool but you are charged some entertainment fee on top of the expensive food and drinks.
568	3	2	since it looks like everyone's already familiar with the rude hostess and long wait for a table (even with a reservation), i'll skip that part.
569	3	2	Waiters and busboys were taking our water glasses and the tip tray off the table before we had counted the change.
570	3	0	The Food This isn't for those on a budget, but portions are generous.
571	3	1	The food is on the good side but not so terrific to compensate the bad service, crammed tiny-tables, dirty glasses, overly loud music, which is good for the bar part of the establishment but not when you want to seat down, eat and have a normal conversation at normal volume.
572	3	0	I just had dinner there with my girlfriend and we had the best time.
573	3	0	Amazing views of NYC regaled us at lunch earlier in the week and then at dinner this evening.
574	3	0	Multiple televisions on both sides of the cozy room ensure unobstructed sight lines for fans, whether they're sipping pints at the oak bar or snacking on pub munchies--like baked clams, nachos, and buffalo wings--at tall tables in front.
575	3	2	The Food  Crave's two chefs have resumes that boast stints at Payard, Nobu and Industry (food), so it's no surprise their menu is full of unusual twists on old favorites.
576	3	2	We were seated quickly (and had reservations, but they didnt seem to be absolutely necessary) and our waitress offered much insight into menu bests and worsts.
577	3	0	The bright point of dinner was dessrt.
578	3	2	A full bar and a dozen different margaritas attract a happy hour crowd, and a tortilla machine is often surrounded by children watching the dough-to-tortilla transformation.
579	3	1	Their appetizer portions are not huge, just right since the entrees are much larger.
580	3	2	the waiter didn't recommen any special for the night, didn't come back to the table to check if everything is okay, didn't even offer me the dessert menu at the end.
581	3	1	Just don't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there.
582	3	0	It has the most authentic Mexican found I have found in the Metro area and the margaritas are outstanding.
583	3	2	food arrived quickly and was hot and v good, just don't be on a diet if you are going to eat here as no real options for slimmers!!
584	3	2	The menu showcases Thai-French favorites: fresh chopped hai (white fish) and salmon with Chinese black olives and basil oil; mussels in coconut-lemon grass broth; and garlicky octopus sauteed with ground pork, broccoli rabe and lime juice.
585	3	2	There were three parties of two standing in the front entrance looking like bumbling idiots while not a single host, waiter, or manager attended to us.
586	3	0	The characters were very entertaining, and while the prices are a little steep, it is well worth the cost.
587	3	0	We ordered a platter that was an asssortment of appetizers which was great recomendation.
588	3	2	If you don't mind eating great thai food in a schnazzy ambience with a hop hip lunch crowd, then come on over to SPICE.
589	3	1	Beautiful rooms filled with beautiful people, but expensive for what it is ($68 prix fixe), limited menu, tiny portions, reeeeeeeally slow service, undercooked potatoes with the cod, less than fascinating desserts.
590	3	0	The owners Pat and John are very friendly and can often sit and have a beer with you.
591	3	0	It's not going to win any awards for its decor, but the food is good, the portions are big, and the prices are low.
592	3	2	If you are undecided about which sandwich to choose, go for the Indecision, which is a trio of smaller sandwiches on the menu.
593	3	2	We didn't have reservations, and showing up at 8:45 we were told it would be about an hour wait.
594	3	1	Portions are small, they try to pass themselves off as family style by encouraging sharing and putting dishes in the center of the table, but it is glorified a la carte.
595	3	2	but no reservations makes for a very long wait, usually of an hour.
596	3	1	1) they gave us the wrong table had to wait 10 minutes until they gave us the one we wanted 2) had to wait 15 minutes for a waiter 3) ordered chicken and brocolli.
597	3	2	The wine list was had some of my favorites which I have not seen anywhere in New York, and when I clumsily spilled both water and wine all of the my table the waitress and manager were there in a flash jovially helping me clear up the mess.
598	3	2	We went there on New Year's Day around 7 pm without a reservation and were able to get a table right away thanks to the very accomodating hostess.
599	3	2	The Scene Opened in 1993, Nick's may be the only great pizza place in the city of New York that isn't older than most of the people who eat there.
600	3	0	I was tempted to try the dessert because I've heard rave reviews about it, but we were stuffed, as the portions are fairly large.
601	3	2	The menu has many choices, and the dining experience lends itself to being a great place for a date, client dinner, parents' dinner or even a start-off to a night out on the town.
602	3	0	The Scene Uncomplicated, tasteful touches--a soothing abstract painting, an exposed brick wall, a tiny bar--grace the restaurant's neutral-toned interior.
603	3	2	They were seating people without reservations who were either friends of the employees or were slipping the hostess $20 to get seated without a reservation.
604	3	1	There is a long bar area wide enough to accommodate large crowds, large screen tv's on the walls to view games, but not that do not dominate the atmosphere, and up front there is a large lounge are with several booths and a working fireplace.
605	3	1	I absolutely hate communal seating and closely spaced tables and this place had both, but the atmosphere and the food were such that I was able to get beyond the grumpy mood that put me in to have a really good experience.
606	3	2	I love to go there on weekends and have the delicious french toast (made from baguette slices) or the granola with fresh fruit, sometimes I am so torn that I end up getting both!
607	3	1	Last, but not least, when we walked in, most of the clientelle was Vietnamese and next to us was a food critic whose review was on the back of the menu.
608	3	1	The pooris were miniscule, about 2 bites each; they serve 4 of those as a dinner for $25!
609	3	2	The Scene Honeycomb-colored walls, random wall art, a peek into the kitchen from paper-topped tables--all combine for a casual, thrown-together ambience.
610	3	1	The waitress told us the portions were not big, so we each got an entree and shared a side.
611	3	2	Even if you have to wait a bit for a reservation, the hostess will come over to apologize, update you on the wait and make sure you are comfortable.
612	3	2	The 'people watching' and table location (on boardwalk) made up for the rude service.
613	3	1	Food was good but portions were quite tiny.
614	3	2	The salads were amazing in themselves - mixed greens andtomato wedges in a delicious balsamic vinagrette with slices of Italian bread with warm goat cheese.
615	3	2	Nice ambience and bar while waiting for a table.
616	3	1	If you're looking for barbeque like Dallas BBQ (soaked in sauce from a bottle, generic, homogeneous food) then you won't like Blue Smoke.
617	3	2	For the price I paid for a cup of Bustelo coffee w/ milk I could buy 2 vacumed packs for 3 bucks.
618	3	1	Lost reservations, out of liquor, jam-packed, waiting room, out of wine, sent steak out raw, no choices for dessert, no room to breathe, terrible service, etc.
619	3	2	Although we were seated 35 minutes after our reservation the service from then on was outstanding.
620	3	2	Just make sure you make reservations a few days in advance because there aren't a lot of tables.
621	3	2	When a seemly accommodating Le Souk manager assured you that he had no problem serving a group of twenty on a Saturday evening, I expected him to keep his words or shall I say our table.
622	3	0	Instead of being smart business people and treating us as paying customers, we were told they do not serve drinks, only food (only food?
623	3	1	A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.
624	3	2	The retaurant is know for the long wait but they do take reservation for group of 5-8 people, so it was just perfect for my friend BD dinner for 3 couples.
625	3	2	the soups were superb and only $2 a bowl, and the entire dinner, with beers, cost less than $30 for two people.
626	3	2	On top of that, when we tried to order more food half-way through our first entree order, the waitress told us that we couldn't because they needed the table for another reservation!
627	3	2	8pm reservation, place was half empty on a Saturday.
628	3	0	The Scene The bright mix of colors painted on the cafe's walls matches the vivid margaritas that sit on nearly every table and litter the sceney bar.
629	3	2	The busboy kept our glasses full; the waiter warmed up to our table at the end of the night by cracking jokes.
630	3	2	The head-on shrimps with anchovy butter had me licking the plate.
631	3	2	The wine list didn't look all that great, but there was a very interesting selection of beers on tap.
632	3	2	(We did make reservations, since we had a group of 8, but had a short wait when arriving a little early.
633	3	0	While the appetizers I sampled (gnocchi; shrimp wrapped in coconut or somesuch) were not so impressive (the gnocchi portion is meager and overpriced), my table was 100% satisfied with their entrees too.
634	3	2	Our waiter was pushing us all night to take our plates, and swiped my dessert before I was finised with it.
635	3	0	Or better yet, if on a budget and want to do something romantic, stop at the bar for a drink and enjoy the sunset.
636	3	2	I don't usually go there over the weekends or during prime dinner hours--but for a weekday dinner it's great, and I've never had any problems with crowds, waiting, or bad service.
637	3	1	Finally got our food after waiting a long time for oysters, doesn't take that long to shuck 'em, the place isn't that big, and it was OK.
638	3	1	After a crazy day @ work, with no reservation, we were so lucky to score a seat at the bar on an incredibly busy evening.
639	3	2	The place was so dark, I needed the table candle to read the menu and could not properly see what I was eating.
640	3	1	Dining experience begins with cracked, filthy vinyl tile flooring tables so small close together that you couldn't move.
641	3	2	Silky black bass with porcini mushrooms carries smoky, earthy and buttery overtones that somehow never overpower the fish, and whole-roasted baby pig includes belly meat, braised for 24 hours in five spice-ginger glaze, and yet the pork flavor is still fully present.
642	3	1	When the manager came to our table at the end of the meal and asked how our experience was, I complained to him about the cold.
643	3	0	The meal arrived just as we were finishing the appetizers, each good portions.
644	3	1	both appetizer and main were poorly made by some random cooks the picked up from who knows where.
645	3	2	While I liked the place, I'd never come back in a weekend night again, and with reservations.
646	3	2	when the waitress finally took our order after being seated at the table for over 30 minutes only to wait another 45 minutes for food and when the food arrived the order was incomplete.
647	3	1	The choices on the menu were very limited-discounting raw items, there were practically no appetizers The foie gras de canard was mediocre with a syrupy sauce.
648	3	1	They did a great job on the decor but it seems that the food has gotten a bit less in the quality department, as well as in the portion size!
649	3	2	We decided to order soup (over $6 a bowl), thinking that would be quick, however our waitress then said the soup is OUT OF A CAN and still would be a 20 minute wait since the tickets are processed in order.
650	3	0	The irony of it all is that I tried the fish and chips at a sports bar across the street the following week, 1/2 the price (w/ fries included), and the portion was bigger and much tastier.
651	3	2	The man working the door (red hair)-very funny and warming.
652	3	2	One of my friends told them it was my birthday and the staff relally surprised me when their came to me singing with the mexican hats and a dessert with a candle on it.
653	3	2	) I also noticed the table next to ours didn't enjoy her dish and they went above and beyond to try to make up for it.
654	3	2	Keep in mind, no one else was even in the restaurant and we were asking the waitress questions about entree options.
655	3	2	i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess.
656	3	2	The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size.
657	3	1	Since it changed owners/chefs, the portions are smaller (I always used to ask for a doggie bag for my chic-parm), now I can finish and still be hungry even after appetizers (which aren't as good anymore).
658	3	2	you go all out with dress, tastes, and performance, and in the end its really about having a good time where you truly indulge yoursef in good vodka, compnay, music, and food.
659	3	2	There's even a nice menu of savory items served during late lunch and dinner hours.
660	3	1	The only reason they seem to taste so good is because the food is well decorated with its super small portion.
661	3	2	I live around the corner and I miss the unpretentious and always lovely, Irving on Irving, that used to occupy this space where you didn't need a reservation three weeks in advance to eat dinner after 5:30 and before 11 pm.
662	3	0	large portions so unless you are of large stature you should not get 2 appetizers.
663	3	2	We asked for bread plates when the bread was brought to the table and the server's response was management has decided not to offer bread plates.
664	3	0	The Food This Cajun-Italian menu is lengthier than its Manhattan counterparts--here, adventuresome diners can still design their own pies, but they can also feast on oversized plates of peel-and-eat old bay shrimp and cajun spaghetti with meatballs enlivened with andouille sausage.
665	3	0	In Short It's a bakery, takeout place and cafe all in one, and thanks to dishes prepared using the same ingredients stocked at famed gourmet food emporium, Zabar's, prices and quality are upscale.
666	3	2	I go generally with one friend but on occasion have popped in with more, if a table is not possible, as they are booked solid every night, well, the food and service is just as over-the-top amazing at the bar or in the lounge as it is in the dining room.
667	3	1	The portions were pretty small for the price, I thought, and I never got the coffee I ordered.
668	3	2	The pancakes I ordered were nothing like the menu's description.
669	3	0	I went to Joy hoping to find some great Indian, but unfotunately found curry that was no better than average.
670	3	2	When our first order came, they forgot the torro (which we later learned it was finished for the night.
671	3	1	I don't remember the dessert item but when it was brought out flashing lights overhead threw colored beams on the walls and a young waiter came over to our table and did a little dance that was Bollywood MTV for the East Village set.
672	3	2	The fact that the resteraunt staff couldn't even keep a reservation straight, not to mention that after screwing up, they told us to go scratch and made us wait almost 2 hours.
673	3	1	Drinks took a while, and after a few rounds pf the we're sorry, we don't have this bottle sir routine.
674	3	0	Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!
675	3	2	I am not good with using chopsticks and asked for a fork, instead the owner insisted that I try using a chopstick an made me an easy-to-use chop stick right there on the spot!
676	3	2	The Scene The main dining room of this boisterous Carnegie Hall restaurant, dubbed the New York Room, is a cavernous space with high ceilings and sweeping glass windows.
677	3	1	however the dessert porportions somehow ballooned to regular conventional sizes.
678	3	2	When my group complained to our waiter about a cake cutting fee that involved no cutting, the manager came over to the table and basically told us that it was our fault for not knowing that their policy was just to serve the plates, not to cut.
679	3	2	We waited about 10 minutes for a table and enjoyed peanuts and cocktails at the bar (drinks are $3.
680	3	2	the place had open doors and windows and a very relaxed, candle-lit type of atmosphere.
681	3	2	I had read good reviews about the value and food quality at this restaurant, so I was not surprised to see a decently priced menu (pasta under $10 and entrees approx $12 to $15).
682	3	2	I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name.
683	3	0	Otoro tuna, gorgeously marbled with fat, is captivating; hamachi sashimi, topped by the chef with a whisper of sea salt and a barely-there squeeze of lemon, creates eye-rolling pleasure.
684	3	2	The place is huge, but it's always packed with people waiting to be seated because they made the mistake of not making a reservation!
685	3	2	It took about ten minutes to get out drink ordering after sitting down and once we recieved the bottle our waitress never once refilled our glasses!
686	3	2	Save the $$ and go to to curry hill (just 2-3 blocks away) or spend the $$ at a midtown indian eatery  (Also: I commented to hostess prior to seating that there were a lot of tables empty when choosing my seat, and she snapped back that they had a lot of reservations coming in at one time.
687	3	2	The space is grand with a very high ceiling although it is one of those places that they keep so dark you are not really sure what you are eating anyway.
688	3	1	Beer selection is a bit slim, but seats are plentiful and there are several sports monitors placed about the bar.
689	3	2	The place got really crowded around 8ish when I went right before Christmas so reservations might be necessary.
690	3	0	The drinkers beside us had fresh glasses of water brought on trays to replace the empties and a smiling waitress to cater to their every whim.
691	3	0	The ingredients used are of a good quality and the taste is superb.
692	3	1	In Short Many Murray Hill locals gladly overlook the dull green walls and fluorescent lighting for Jaiya's quick and affordable Thai cooking--if not, they take meals to go or get them delivered.
693	3	0	Wide range of dim sum and food.
694	3	1	Mojitos were good and prices werent bad but sides should be included in price as portions are tiny.
695	3	2	About a half hour wait with reservations.
696	3	2	Party of 4 after a Sunday matinee, no reservation, seated promtply, but service was slow.
697	3	0	Whether it is a weekend brunch, dinner, or just hanging at the bar for cocktails, we always have THE BEST TIME.
698	3	2	The food and the value had been ok on our meal, and then after only a little more than an hour, the check was slipped onto the table for our large party, and a few minutes later, waiters began yelling at us to leave.
699	3	2	sam adams on tap, french fries served out of a brown paper bag and a burger cooked perfectly.
700	3	1	On the other hand, the food was good but not awesome as had been described, furthermore I found the portions fairly small for this type of restaurant.
701	3	1	Although I didn't pay for the meal (and it's about $22 bucks a plate, way over my normal eating range), I have to say that it was better than any food I've ever had in little Italy, and there weren't any touristy elements to be found.
702	3	2	Horrible service, below average cuisine, asked to leave the table before finishing our wine, and forced to have our port at the bar.
703	3	2	We waited FOREVER for a table and when the appetizers arrived they were cold or frozen in the middle!
704	3	2	Let me count the problems: music so loud it hurt, sticky unclean tables, the waitress took a long time to take our order, and then didn't bring a glass for the beer.
705	3	0	I have been back for several dinners and lunchs and especially like the terrace when weather permits.
706	3	0	Best value is the sushi/sashimi lunch combo - get the large for double pieces on sushi!
707	3	0	The Scene Superfine is an easygoing, instantly appreciable neighborhood hangout that boasts a kitchen staff armed with serious cooking chops.
708	3	2	We waited for 1 hour each time the waitress came over to our table.
709	3	1	When we arrived, our table wasn't ready and we waited 30 minutes in the bar.
710	3	2	26 seats also has the most reasonable prices in NYC, it is a true gem.
711	3	2	There is no waiting area, so we had a crowd hovering over our table, this is just testament to how many people want to eat there.
712	3	2	My dining experience with friends started off very badly - 40 minute wait WITH a reservation and having to repeatedly ask for bread and water - but ended on a better note.
713	3	2	We have been waiting for months for a 8pm reservation at this very average restaurant.
714	3	1	For the price and quality of the food we got, I would not dine here again.
715	3	2	I like how the ambiance changes from the cafeteria style of lunch to a sit down dinner in romantic lighting.
716	3	0	Mostly, this small restaurant offers eggs, hot sandwiches and traditional American platters.
717	3	2	The Scene The bar's upbeat Latin music, colorful stools and cocktail napkins, and a fruity drink menu are the first confirmations that Agozar lives up to its translation: A good time.
718	3	2	Came here for a b-day and ended up waiting so long even for a reservation.
719	3	2	The hostess finally seated us at a table for two when there were three of us in an empty restaurant.
720	3	2	after booking reservations at Danube, only to show up and not have any tables available, the Danube somelier graciously called over to Bouley and got us a table for immediate seating.
721	3	0	In the winter they have the fireplaces working which immediately creates a cozy romantic feel.
722	3	0	We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in thier food in evident.
723	3	2	After the wonderful anipasto tray came, it was 60 minutes before our plates were removed and dinner was brought.
724	3	2	I've since been back for a regular dining night out, it was packed and I should have made a reservation (the wait was a little long).
725	3	2	When we sat, our dinner was delivered promplty (Like FAST) and we had plenty of time to make The Goat, which by the way I also recommend highly (Great Show!
726	3	1	When we first walked in, we saw other diners wiping their plates with bread- so we though that the food was good -but we very soon realized that the portions really were so small that you really have to lick your plate clean - afterall, their dinners costs a fortune.
727	3	2	hard to work a buzz with the server taking so long between every round, but worth trying the signature african rum cocktail and happily surprised they had our favorite white - sancerre by the glass at this japanese restaurant.
728	3	2	Usually you lose food quality the trendier you go, but not at this place.
729	3	2	Aged beef charred on the outside, red on the inside.
730	3	0	The bar had a hip DJ and the crowd was ultra chic.
731	3	2	After waiting for 90 minutes, the host gave away our table to a couple who arrived after us.
732	3	2	We started with some drinks on the front porch and then continued at our table with a bottle of delicious red wine.
733	3	2	(They even let us bring our own cake for the event, which many restaurants may not allow you too) They food was good as I only sampled so I can't really comment.
734	3	0	Althought the menu is more expensive than your average Mexican restaurant, it is not more expensive than any other hip, increadibly well designed, bar scene and dining room in Manhattan -could be less in fact.
735	3	0	It is expensice, but the portions are big and include a side, salad, nan and rice along with your main meal!
736	3	1	We explained that we had left a standard 15% on food, and a slightly smaller percentage on alcohol (At least 10%).
737	3	2	We weren't sure we'd even get a table,surprisingly the lovely hostess assured us she'd get us in if we gave her 15 minutes in the bar.
738	3	2	Even with our reservation, they had us waiting at the bar for over an hour.
739	3	2	Perhaps it's early and they will improve but service is VERY slow - took a good 25min for waiter to take our order on both visits and the second time I was one of three tables at a 5:30pm reservation so not like it was busy.
740	3	0	Ive personally tried almost everything on the menu and been amazed at the quality and presentation.
741	3	2	By the time you get to the table, it'll have been WELL worth the wait.
742	3	2	The steak is brought to the table soaked in grease.
743	3	1	17 for a small cup of tea.
744	3	2	Finally, the manager had the audacity to lock the doors, presumably to prevent us from skipping out on the bill, while one of our friends went to an ATM to get cash.
745	3	2	And for families they have high chairs and waiters were really nice to my kid.
746	3	0	Their main chef Louie, makes the oddest specials you will ever see and the portions are quite large.
747	3	2	The wait staff were incredibly attentive, though as a warning, if you like wine, but also a little privacy, this might not be a good idea, since they have the tendency to hover a bit.
748	3	2	When we confronted the hostess, she told us that there were 3 of them and only 2 of us, and that the 3 women had a reservation at 8:30pm.
749	3	0	For appetizers, wine, dinner, desert, great convesation, expect to spend a couple of hours.
750	3	2	They crumbed the table once, although it was solied the entire meal.
751	3	2	But then there's the sluggish and absentminded service: twice someone tried to serve us something for another table and it took a long time to get our check.
752	3	2	The seafood is out of this world and priced accordingly.
753	3	2	One of the managers offered us a seat at the bar to wait for a table, there we had the most amazing empanadas and red sangria.
754	3	2	When the hostess finally appears she tells me that she can't seat us on the mostly empty patio because all the open tables are for dinner not drinks.
755	3	0	That was totally acceptable and we found some great seats at the bar.
756	3	2	Come-as-you-are atmosphere, jukebox, value and James behind the bar work as a magnet.
757	3	1	In retrospect, that was kind of foolish, as the portions for dinner were obscene.
758	3	0	The scene is reasonably cool but unworth more than a drink.
759	3	2	05 bar of melted chocolate in a cup.
760	3	1	A bright spot: the server was immeadiately apologetic and whisked problem plates away, and replacements were prompt.
761	3	2	The Food Diners are prompted to order several shareable dishes which, considering the food isn't what's drawing most of the crowd, are surprisingly good.
762	3	0	Everything on the menu is satisfyingly savory, from a simple pot of mussels in a choice of sauces (beer-and-bacon, creamy mushroom, or white-wine-and-garlic broth), to beef stewed with beer and prunes, to a juicy croque-monsieur, and beyond.
763	3	2	Waiting for a table is par for the course.
764	3	2	The server seemed drunk, he forgot mixed up our food with some other table, ignored our requests for more water, drinks etc.
765	3	1	Tiny slices of pie with a dribble of cream topped off the evening.
766	3	2	The Scene The bruising thoroughfare that is East 57th Street is the last place you'd expect to find an intimate, adorably decorated Northern Italian spot where it's actually possible to have a quiet, pleasant dinner.
767	3	2	i love this pizza, its not greasy or filled with mounds of cheese, its just fresh tomatoes basil and buffalo mozz.
768	3	2	This place is even good for just drinks after work (nice bar) I am going back there as soon as I get a chance.
769	3	1	Desserts were pleasent enough, if not trying way to hard on presentation, lacking portions and interest.
770	3	2	Our server spilled a drink on the table cloth and it was cleaned up in an instant, no mess, free drinks to compensate, and left us impressed at how seamlessly this was fixed.
771	3	1	If you want to avoid the long lines, arrive at 5:00 PM and have an early dinner.
772	3	2	I agree with the many posters addressing an oppressively aggressive waitstaff, and I'm in particular support of the review directed at Franny's bizarrely adamant refusal to cut pizza (or provide adaquate knives/plates for us to do it ourselves).
773	3	1	Nonetheless, it's an excellent pie -- and don't let the long lines scare you off -- they keep them moving.
774	3	2	5 minutes later the same waitress came back to have us move to the next table so she could seat a party of 4.
775	3	0	In the dim lighting, I thought the portions were impressive and dug in.
776	3	0	The whole table must participate and you have to be willing to let the chef cook for you with no menu.
777	3	0	waiters were very nice, they dont take reservations during the week end, we waited at the bar with some sangria, Very good experience, loud music but we were able to communicate easily, overall i recommand this place to groups and dates,   Will be back more often!
778	3	0	After having the table cleared and recieving fresh warm plates, we shared the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chicken and Lentils.
779	3	2	The server spilled beer on the table when he poured it; he dropped ice cubes for another one of our guests and water everywhere else.
780	3	1	It was more than enough food even though the portions are tiny.
781	3	2	It is a small restaurant so without reservations, there can be a long wait.
782	3	2	Beers on tap were pretty good and we had a great waiter but the food left much to be desired.
783	3	1	The hummus was not flavorful and when we ran out of bread and asked for more, it never came.
784	3	2	That's almost enough to prove its legitimacy to me, but eating there, both for a quick slice and sit-down for pasta with my family has always been a delicious, inexpensive and fun experience.
785	3	0	Then another pleasant surprise - the menu said we had to share the entree for each couple.
786	3	0	I can't imagine how small the fish portion on the $10 lunch menu must be if I got the large one.
787	3	2	Yellowtail tuna carpaccio, lightly dressed with a hint of mint, sings of summer, and crab salad partnered with sweet-hot mango mustard and greens hits all the right flavor notes.
788	3	2	The menu alternates between typical American fare (salads, potato skins, Angus burgers and grilled chicken) and modestly international cuisine like fajitas, wraps and pot stickers.
789	3	0	The menu had some slight twists to conventional upscale Mexican.
790	3	1	For dessert we split the combination platter, which had rather small portions but they were good.
791	3	2	Unfortunately, that lunch can take a loooooong time as the waiters seem to forget food orders, forget drink orders, and forget to refill water glasses.
792	3	2	The Food Recalling an era of calorie-defying decadence--hard liquor, red meat, cigars and mammoth portions--gluttony is the operative word here.
793	3	2	The complete and total rudeness and frustration surrounding this place started with the hostess calling us in the middle of the afternoon asking if we could change our reservation.
794	3	0	Not the most adventurous nor exquisite food, but generous portions (at least, on the 3-course prix fixe) that were faultlessly executed, complemented by a varied wine list ranging from that special bottle for a celebratory splurge to excellent choices under $50.
795	3	2	So are cooked plates: Marinated Kobe beef practically melts on its skewers, soy-buttered scallops collapse with sweet brine and Chawanmushi custard, quivering in eel-soy broth with black truffles and foie gras, is over the top.
796	3	1	Not the ideal spot when you're really hungry -- the plates are tiny and the prices not (like every other upscale tapas place).
797	3	2	The waitress only stopped at our table to take our order and pick up the check.
798	3	2	We got there before our reservation and the seated us quickly.
799	3	1	The Scene Tucked away on the second floor of a small, nondescript Madison Avenue building, Caviar Russe feels more like a private club than a restaurant.
800	3	2	The waiter, of course had no knowledge of the yet to be produced wine list and no wine steward or manager bothered to come by the table to check in.
801	3	2	The only complaints (minor) was a 15 minute wait when we had a 10 PM reservation and the tables are pretty close to one another.
802	3	0	Also, if you order a dinner, plan to have leftovers for the next day because the portions are HUGE, the salad that comes with a meal is large enough to be a meal itself.
803	3	1	Food is decent but portions are so tiny and the whole meal is served on huge plate which makes it look even more ridiculous.
804	3	2	Went to Public last Saturday, couldn't get a table so the lovely host suggested that my partner and I dine at the bar.
805	3	0	Aside from the service being slow, the place was packed w/ a good crowd and music was amazing.
806	3	2	After making reservations almost a month in advance, I was very disappointed to be seated in a secluded area for dinner next to the sushi bar and KITCHEN!!!!!!!
807	3	2	I mean no disrespect to the owner, just constructive criticism - improve the decor and dine-in service, but DON'T change the portions or the recipes.
808	3	2	Although the waitress had clearly our reservation on her book, she told us somebody arrived one minute ago and being first to arrive, he could have our table.
809	3	2	it would be better to place the bar closer to the front of the restaurant and away from the tables.
810	3	2	The hostess failed to inform us of that the restuarnt was hosting a private company party when we made the reservation.
811	3	2	The manager very politely told the drunk man that he could leave and then gave everyone on the resturaunt a free glass of port for having to witness it.
812	3	2	All the dishes that we had at our table were consistently good, although not great (nor poor, either).
813	3	0	Delivery portions are bigger and 2 can easily share 1 entree.
814	3	1	Xunta's tapas dishes were great though a little pricey for small plates.
815	3	2	We had a very nice and entertaining waitress who was very much on top of our table.
816	3	1	Portion was just a bit small compare with other restaurant but the price was lower than usualy as well (7.
817	3	2	Then the huffy hostess when we asked to be seated at a table not directly on-top of another couple.
818	3	1	Other than its impossible reservation (no matter how many months you call in advance, the only available time slots for dinner on a Saturday are always 4:45 or 9:45), Peter Luger is worth the drive over to Brooklyn.
819	3	2	Reservations are no guarantee of prompt seating, have a pre-game drink, pop a xanax and you can handle the drama of having a res and getting no love from the hostess.
820	3	1	They were out of cherry, so we got a few slices of apple and one key lime.
821	3	2	and you have to order through a pane of bulletproof glass, but the fact of the matter is, after a night of hard drinkin', college style, nothing hits the spot like a big box of inexpensive chicken and fries.
822	3	0	Maybe go there for the view, but don't bother eating there, go to the bar.
823	3	0	I am vegetarian - so this review applies only to the veg portion of their menu.
824	3	1	Seconds after we permitted our half-eaten fattened goose livers to be whisked away, our waitress materialized, bearing two cold drinks and the chef's profound apologies for the dish - a completely unneccessary but vastly appreciated gesture.
825	3	2	Remember the 80's when you have to wait 1-2 hours for a table even though you have a reservation + the wait staff treated you like the idiot that you are for paying $2-300 per head for this treatment, then you should definately come to experience this jewel!!
826	3	2	I love the complimentary hot salsa and fresh chips that they put on the table !
827	3	1	After ordering our food was brought to our table very quickly despite the huge crowd.
828	3	2	The Scene Behind the often-fogged windows at this small restaurant is a homey atmosphere, full of smiling employees and Filipino families crowded around simple red tables.
829	3	2	I like to drink a variety of teas, but I've had some here that are really weird that I would avoid next time.
830	3	1	But, as I said, it's a dive bar, so it's not someplace you'd take a high-maintenance individual.
831	3	0	sometimes i've just ordered arepas and empanadas for my meal; other times, i've split a dinner entree and an appetizer with a friend and been satisfied, since the portions are so huge.
832	3	1	my table of four was not totaly neglected, but there was a lag in how promptly we were being served.
833	3	2	Avoid this restaurant on a busy night at all costs -- they have yet to learn how to make the appropriate number of reservations; the front of the house and the managers are amateurs.
834	3	2	When we finally had to see the manager because I had lemon juice spilled on me from the waiter- she even took over 10 minutes to come to the table.
835	3	2	However, another server kept hovering over our table, wanting to take our half-finished plates away.
836	3	0	The Food The versatile Austrian menu, fused with French and American, rewards both high and low-end appetites: rich, cheese-laden onion soup, grilled Gruyere and country ham sandwiches and big-bunned burgers are as satisfying as velvety liver terrine with kumquat-cranberry compote, speck and sausage charcuterie and inexpensive cheese plates.
837	3	2	Not only did they refuse to give me any milk but they charged me full price ($9) for plain udon noodles - no broth, veggies, or meat just wet noodles in a bowl.
838	3	2	When the ice cream cake I ordered didnt hold up in their regular freezers temperature, Giovanny immediately had a server run out and got an identical cake in 15 minutes.
839	3	1	I definitely liked the vibe in the restaurant - the food is good with enough variety to please everyone - i'd say the portions were quite skimpy where it counts - meat whether fish or steak- and for those prices this is very irksome.
840	3	2	At one point, I spilled my water glass--when I informed the waiter of this he said he would clean it up--he never got around to it.
841	3	0	The food had a somewhat elevated price tag but but fair considering the Nobu origin - The cocktails highly recommended including the spide and lobster roll - we were well plated and did not encounter any arragance from the staff - maybe the other student reviewers are used to cafeteria service.
842	3	0	The only bad thing was that the third alien was so friendly and took a lot of time at the other tables, so she didn't come see us.
843	3	0	huuge portions, which made it much easier paying the $350 bill.
844	3	0	I adore Zen Palate - and both the formal upstairs dining room and the crowded, counter-style cafe downstair, have their pros and cons.
845	3	2	The upside of Zen Palate is the open kitchen, which allows you to watch the cooks at work and removes fears of who only knows what the chefs are doing in the back.
846	3	0	This seems to be a big hit and draws a large crowd, so be prepared for a wait.
847	3	2	The Scene Though this looks like any other sushi counter, with purple vinyl booths and a koi pond in the small dining room, there are glimpses of superiority.
848	3	0	Low-fat and low-carb options (such as flatbread) lure in health-conscious diners, while everyone else can sink their teeth into warm, crispy baguettes piled with mesquite chicken or smoked turkey, Philly cheese steaks and more.
849	3	2	I finally cancelled our order, the waiter came back in 5 min with our plates.
850	3	0	Called to complain and the response was well, we didn't charge you for the falafel sandwich we shorted you.
851	3	2	The tasting menu was delivered at a break-neck pace, leaving no time to enjoy the wine or even digest the food.
852	3	0	Needing a sugar fix, my husband and I walked in here to find a wall to wall adornment of delightful confections.
853	3	2	The hostess told me she could accomodate my group without a reservation but we ended up waiting nearly an hour and were seated in the smallest cramped area.
854	3	2	Thought I didn't have reservations, the hostess politely informed me that it would be a 45 minute wait and we were actually seated in 40.
855	3	2	We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional.
856	3	2	It's very cheap, food is great you can bring your own bottle of wine (saves sooo much money) The waiters will uncork it bring you glasses too !
857	3	2	The Scene Inconspicuous Bottino is an ideal stop for a light lunch or full dinner while gallery-hopping through Chelsea.
858	3	0	The presentation was clever, and the food tasty however the service that accompanied it was so slow it made us feel neglected.
859	3	0	great trendy spot for a night out but to be honest the food was not worth the cost.
860	3	2	Upstairs they have an entirely separate hostess, as if it was a different restaurant all together, where after being asked once again if we had a reservation we were seated in a small seat, in the corner, of a practically empty room.
861	3	2	Service was a little but flawed, (they brought us beers without the glasses brought the main course out before cleaning off the appetizers) but nothing that would ruin your evening.
862	3	2	I had a party of 9 reservation and was very disappointed at the service.
863	3	1	Expect a crowd while waiting, but they seat quickly.
864	3	2	We had reservations, and so did the strangers, and yet the management claimed the other tables were reserved.
865	3	0	The Scene North Square's discreet, sedate decor appeals to the largley older crowd occupying the dining room whilst a younger set parties in the back bar.
866	3	0	We went out on the town with the idea that we were going to mingle with the in crowd, you know, go to a place where you pay an outrageous cover charge, have to wear all black to fit in, and pay $12 for a watered-down martini, and if you're lucky, have a good time.
867	3	1	When we got there, they refused to seat us because our 4th wasn't there yet-even thought there were only two other people there and we assured them we would order some starters and drinks.
868	3	0	People waiting for tables stand at a drink rail next to large windows which open out over a leafy garden in the summertime.
869	3	0	My friends and I went to dinner last weekend and had a great time.
870	3	2	After sitting at the table with empty glasses for a 1/2 hour, we had to ask the busboys to get us drinks as our waiter was nowhere to be found.
871	3	1	The texture of their flat noodles is something that has to be experienced to understand.
872	3	2	the service was slow took ten mins to get me a glass of water.
873	3	1	Yes, the prices SEEM afordable, but the portions are so small that you end up spending $100+ just to fill 2 people and get a couple drinks.
874	3	2	I asked the waiter to move us to another table because we didn't want to rush our meal.
875	3	2	Like the other Bromberg Brothers establishments, expect the customer is always wrong attitude from the staff along with overpriced wines you never heard of, no bar, tiny waiting area and lousy desserts.
876	3	0	The Scene With its long zinc bar, plush couches and patterned suede walls, the lounge is a swank spot for midtown's cocktail crowd.
877	3	2	The atmosphere was fun and if you sit by the window, there is a lot of people-watching to be had!
878	3	2	Despite talking to the weekday manager on the prior Monday, who gave me a hard time but agreed to make a reservation for me since my group was so big.
879	3	0	The menu consists of a tasting selection, Austrian, traditional American, and the chef's recommended menu.
880	3	2	Also, try to get a seat at the main bar, because I sat at the smaller bar by the entrance and it was getting so crowded with people waiting that it became a bit unpleasant towards to end of the meal.
881	3	0	The sandwiches, platters, and pitzas are top notch too, but I could make a meal just out of their pita bread and babaganoush.
882	3	2	Definitely make reservations if you can -- they'll honor them, and you can skip the massive wait!
883	3	0	The waiters, all wearing black suits, are serious, courteous, and knowledgeable; the dining rooms are ornate and convivial, with large parties celebrating various things interspersed with dressed-up couples on dates.
884	3	0	When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.
885	3	2	We had a reservation for Monday lunch and were seated promptly, which was a pleasant surprise.
886	3	2	The staff was courteous and explained the menu with detail.
887	3	0	The best aspect of Dylan Prime is that it's a perfect spot for a first date, a business dinner, a casual night-on-the-town or even just a quite bite at lunch.
888	3	2	We too had reservations but the gentleman never checked a book to see our names or check us off.
889	3	0	I liked the beer selection!
890	3	2	There was a ten minute wait with a reservation, but the bar kept us entertained.
891	3	0	I don't expect an enormous, heaping plate of food, but c'mon.
892	3	1	Generous portions of rice porridge and noodles really hit the spot after fighting the crowds on a busy weekend in Chinatown.
893	3	0	Relaxed neighborhooders treat the spot like a second home, calling the staff by name and lingering despite the smallish bar and hurried courses.
894	3	2	The Wasa Waffle was different but when we spoke to the manager he inmediatly changed if for another dish (He suggested the Chocolate decadence French Toast.
895	3	2	The good service started from the moment we walked in the front door.
896	3	2	Now, I expressed my surprise and then the bartender and manager chimed in with a simpleton's remark sir, with restaurants at this time, reservations start coming in.
897	3	2	we wanted to join another 2 top table to ours and the manager abruptly said, that won't work for us!
898	3	0	Got a seat quick, and had some weird fill-out order form for a hard to understand menu.
899	3	1	The guacamole at $7 is a small portion served with a stack of Si!Ortega flat taco shells.
900	3	2	The sign outside said, 26 beers on tap, however the bartender was unable to pull a pint from any of them.
901	3	2	no need for reservation) you'd expect the crew to be alittle more attentive.
902	3	1	At one point I noticed the grime on the mustard bottle and asked the waitress for a clean one.
903	3	2	They have a lot of beautiful clientele, gay and straight, plus you#146;ll spot random famous actors on occasion.
904	3	2	I had dinner with a few of my friends, and it was the best we've had in a long time.
905	3	0	The crowd doesn't disappoint: A well-heeled, fashionable clientele packs the polished-wood-and-glass-partitioned space, settling into one of two dining rooms, or the bar, which is located at the farthest corner from the entrance.
906	3	2	Their bagels have the perfect softness to them, but on the outside there's a bit of crispiness to give it a bit of texture.
907	3	1	The food is average, however the service is way below average (our waiter was a stuttering fool when it came to the specials and left our drinks empty for the majority of the night) The atmostphere is cheesy as well as the crowd.
908	3	1	$25 prix fixe sounds like a good deal, but dinner was still $100 for two, the portions were small, and the ($35) wine, clearly where the money is made, mediocre.
909	3	1	Mysteriously, the reserved tables all stayed empty throughout our meal and were still empty when we left an hour later.
910	3	1	I don't have much to say about the cafe itself; you can order out from the family-run cafe in the front, or take a seat in the back, which opens up to the outdoors and can offer a less seedy and more homey atmosphere.
911	3	0	Large portions of food to share.
912	3	2	From making the reservation (not required) to the before dinner drink (cava), to the table (romantic), to the the ambiance (candles, spanish antiques, etc) to the food of course (original, incredibly deep and rich in flavor) to our departure and saying goodnight to the waiter.
913	3	2	Staples are available every which way--tacos hard and soft, wrapped in tortillas stuffed with guacamole, cheese or black beans; burritos of beef, breaded catfish, pork pipian and chipotle chicken; plus a choice of four sauces from mild to just plain stupid.
914	3	2	If you can get a corner table you can see the entire room while eating in elegance.
915	3	1	After our waitress brought us menus took our drink orders, a diff hostess came over asked us to give up our table.
916	3	1	(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.
917	3	2	But the food here is excellant and there are just too many appetizers (in the traditional custom of Korean restaurants) to sample.
918	3	0	The portions were so big that after a cocktail drink we had no room left for desert.
919	3	2	Our waiter ask us what kind of soufle we wanted and told us to get 2, making us believe that it was part of the pre-fixe, nope soufles are seperate and we were so full from dinner we could barely finish one.
920	3	1	It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.
921	3	1	(Though the filet won't be enough if both have hearty apitites.
922	3	2	The place is packed, they don't take reservations and waited almost 2 hours.
923	3	2	Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles.
924	3	2	the service is so-so; our waiter told us there was a table for us, then took us back to the entrance , we then waited another fifteen minutes- confusion seems to reign.
925	3	1	Generally, the food was fine, but the table is too small to eat comfortably.
926	3	2	we told our waiter to make five selections for each of us, and he decided instead to charge us for each glass separately instead ($80 instead of $20).
927	3	1	Food is decent but portions so small that after 5 appetizers, 2 sides and three entrees, the three of us left still hungry!
928	3	1	Sushi pieces are smaller if u r a 'buffet' customer and choices are rather limited and there's really nothing special on the menu.
929	3	2	A huge Coca-Cola sign dominates the bar, and cute waiters whisk plates of 'cue across the dining room and to the sidewalk patio.
930	3	2	We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.
931	3	0	The Scene This storefront eatery is decked with colorful Mexican art and party kitsch, but it gets dim and moody enough in the evenings to suit a date.
932	3	1	For lunch, walk in slightly after 1pm to avoid long lines.
933	3	2	the hostess is rude as can be, the waiters can't stop to check in, the busboys are flinging stuff on your table, and that's true even when the restaurant is half empty!
934	3	0	We happen to walk by, read the menu posted outside they offered a nice selection ranging from citrus salmon, pan seared trout, chicken pot pie, sirlion steak, the fried calamari is out of this world they use a secret ingredient to their dipping sauce.
935	3	0	I have gotten warmer and much friendlier welcome and outstanding service at the other Thai restaurants in the Greenpoint area.
936	3	2	Lastly the waiters and bartender should learn to have argurments in private and not in front of customers.
937	3	2	I won't even wait for an hour and a half when I don't have reservations, but the hostess and the pompous maitre d' just jerked me around and kept on promising me that I'd be the next to be seated.
938	3	2	at the end of the meal the hostess came to us and rudely ask us to leave the table, we were astonished by her attitude.
939	3	2	I love the food here, and although it is pricey, the entree comes with rice, naan, dal, and salad, which makes it worthwhile.
940	3	0	If you like an ecclectic crowd and an overall good time where you and your friends can get together whether it be to eat, drink or just play some good old pictionary (they provide crayons and a blank white sheet at every table), go to the Cargo!
941	3	2	Much to my satisfaction, I was seated promptly without a reservation and soon after being seated was greeted by my server.
942	3	2	before we could say anything, one waiter picked it up while another brought a knife to our table on a platter.
943	3	2	Although we had to wait a few minutes for our table, the manager bought us a round of drinks and proceeded to take care of throughout the entire meal.
944	3	0	Generous portions on the entrees.
945	3	2	After asking the waiter for a few minutes to look over the menu, we had to call out several times over 15 minutes to get him to come back to our table.
946	3	0	Not a destination restaurant, but if you're hungry for breakfast or lunch, big portions and good quality for the money.
947	3	2	Good wines under $100 are included in the predominantly French list, but take some ferreting out to find.
948	3	2	anyway, nice place for brunch for selection under $20 meals desserts were great (3 flavors for creme brulee!!
949	3	0	Second, the value was great; after ordering a ton of food and several drinks, the bill still came to less than $40 a person (though I suspect that the nice manager might have given us a few freebees!
950	3	2	We arrived about 15 minutes late for a Friday 12:30 reservation, but the staff couldn't have been nicer.
951	3	2	I have eaten here for nearly three years, with firends with family, the service is great attentive and informed, perfect for Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.
952	3	2	After dinner I walked over to the cheese counter -after having been greeted by a rude server, I was shocked to see how dissapointing their cheese selection was: it is miniscule, many of the fresh chevre cheese were more than ready to be tossed, etc.
953	3	2	Our waiter disappeared entirely, our food, when we were finally able to order it, arrived without plates (we had to go and track down a busboy to get them), and when we were finished, we couldn't get the check, even after walking across the restaurant to request it.
954	3	2	I would wait for a table next time, the food was that good.
955	3	2	I tried that on a Friday, told the guy otside the door that I did not have a reservation and he said, You may as well just leave now.
956	3	2	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, MAKE RESERVATIONS FAR IN ADVANCE TO AVOID LONG WAIT TIMES.
957	3	2	The hostess made sure we knew where the lounge was since all the seats at the bar were full and had the waiter come over to take our drink order.
958	3	2	Our waiter was ever so helpful as he stood back and watched my sister and I physically move our table.
959	3	2	The Scene Schnack feels a lot like a roller-rink concession stand circa 1982, from the deep vinyl booths and beat-up chairs right down to the loud music and plastic menu boards.
960	3	1	Fantastic flavor, but certainly not worth the high price of the small glass.
961	3	1	The food is above average, though the portions a tad small, even for tapas; but they more than make up for it with their wonderfull mojitos.
962	3	1	After being given a bad table at Becco and leaving there, we walked around and decided on Da Rosina because the price was right and the menu looked good.
963	3	0	We waited in the bar area and had an excellent time waiting for dinner with the bartender and staff.
964	3	2	Had the calves liver alla veneziana in a fine rich and complex sauce with perfectly fried onions.
965	3	1	When she wasn't being sarcastic or downright rude, she spent her time studiously ignoring our table or pointing us out to the other waitstaff.
966	3	2	Also, neither our waiter or busboy ever came back to ask if we wanted more to drink or even refill our WATER glasses.
967	3	2	I just think the prices are high for the type of food the kitchen turns out as well as the portion sizes.
968	3	1	I used to love the Dog but now its become a metling pot of really undesirable people.
969	3	2	We had reservations and were seated immediately, got a nice table by the window.
970	3	2	The appetizers are really pricey particularly once you see the size (or lack thereof).
971	3	1	Despite the servers' best intentions, it's easy to feel rushed while perusing the menu -- an awkwardly large blackboard.
972	3	2	I said, that would be fine and had the hostess confirm my reservation before hanging up.
973	3	2	My date and I were excited to go, and didn't even mind the 25 minute wait (EVEN WITH OUR RESERVATION) to get a table.
974	3	2	After waiting to get a table for over a half hour even though we had reservations, we went up to the host.
975	3	2	Service was a treat from my French (Canandian)waiter who knows more about wine than anyone waiting on me in NYC in a long time.
976	3	2	After losing our reservation the staff at March called 24 hours later to apologize and ask if we would still like to dine there.
977	3	2	My wife and I had an 8:30 reservation, we show up a few minutes before and the host mumbles something to us about waiting at the bar and they'll tell us when the table is ready.
978	3	0	I had a nice time, place was crowded but the food was very good.
979	3	2	The servers were snobby and got mad at me when I asked if they serve by the slice.
980	3	2	Knew we were in trouble when the waiter spilled our cocktails on the table and couldn't be bothered to bring new silverware.
981	3	2	My one complaint: Even though we arrived at our reservation time, the host asked us to wait at the bar -- then forgot to seat us (I had to ask).
982	3	2	And the waiter actually replied, yes that's why it took you so long to get a reservation.
983	3	1	Although it was quite good, the small portions at this table of 4, including appetizers, did not constitute adequate sustenance.
984	3	2	However when I returned to my table the waiter immediately came over and said So I guess we are celebrating a birthday here.
985	3	2	The wait (despite reservation) was 35 minutes (in an over-crowded bar) no apologies whatsoever.
986	3	2	It's got funky, fun furniture and a round bar at the front, which is convenient for those waiting to be seated and be prepared to wait for a while, if you don't have reservations.
987	3	2	The bar is small so come close to reservation time.
988	3	2	The Food Despite the restaurant's name, the menu is remarkably Atkins-friendly, from the nibble bowls of spicy fried chickpeas to the grilled slabs of salt-flecked, smoky rib-eye, succulent chunks of rosemary roast chicken and fat tubes of springy grilled squid.
989	3	0	The Scene At this sleek spot on a relatively sparse stretch of Spring Street, regulars belly up to a small bar and greet owner Giorgio DeLuca, of Dean and DeLuca fame, with warm hugs.
990	3	0	The kitchen also offers just a few sushi-free entree options, such as a masterful tempura dinner and chicken or salmon teriyaki.
991	3	2	I would only recommend this restaurant to a friend if waiting at least 40 minutes for your RESERVATION is acceptable, and you don't mind paying for relatively standard fare.
992	3	2	The waitress came back to our table several times to ensure we were well catered for.
993	3	1	Here's how it works: you walk in, sit down, and have a vegetarian thali (group of little portions of curries) that invariably includes lentiles, a small salad, some rice, some kind of samosa-like pastry, yogurt, rice, and a couple of sauces.
994	3	0	We sat in the tables in front of the bar and it was a good people watching spot.
995	3	1	Though if the restaurant got bigger, the service and quality of the food would probably suffer.
996	3	0	from the white sheets that hang when you come into the restaurant, to the gorgeous marble communal table in the center of the bottom floor, to the great atmosphere upstairs at the bar.
997	3	2	We waited for thirty minutes for our table, and after inquiring once about the status, we were rudely confronted by the hostess.
998	3	2	I had a reservation for a Staurday night and after a 1 hour and 45 minute wait, we still were not seated!!
999	3	2	We were lucky because chef Gari was there when we visited, and himself prepared the platter for us.
1000	3	2	Although we didn't have a reservation, my husband and I enjoyed the food and drinks at the kitchen side seating.
1001	3	2	As we were wrapping up a very rushed meal--appetizers were barely started when the entrees arrived crowding a table for two at which three were crammed--the hostess charged over and grabbed a half-full wine glass declaring thanks ladies, I'll get your check.
1002	3	2	Our waitress' visits to our table were few and far between.
1003	3	2	After making our party wait for about an hour past our reservation time (which we chalked up to it being a busy Friday night), they gave us a wobbly makeshift table that was set up in the path of the staff rushing out of the kitchen.
1004	3	0	And after we ordered our food, their wine guy suggested the wine that he thought would go best with our selections, and it was surprisingly not a high-priced bottle.
1005	3	2	I requested the waiter to seat us at a different table, and he was like 'its the same everywhere', and walked off.
1006	3	1	I would not return for a $30 entree of inadequate portions.
1007	3	1	This restaurant has taken the trend of serving tiny portions on oversized plates to a new level.
1008	3	0	And like all McNally hot spots, it crackles with energy, particularly from the groups who gather to share a bite in the bar.
1009	3	2	Our reservation was for 9, didn't get seated until 9:20 with no acknowledgment by the staff of the delay.
1010	3	1	When I tried getting a lunch order delivered, I was told I was out of the delivery range (strange since I am also located in the East Village).
1011	3	2	Stumbled unto this little gem early one saturday afternoon and was thoroughly pleased with the wonderful little backyard.
1012	3	2	The main floor space is lovely, but cavernous (which means *VERY* noisy), so our server was especially patient with us since we couldn't hear each other or her half the time.
1013	3	2	NOTE: Plan ahead, make a reservation and arrive early - parking is tight in the area - valet service is available if all else fails!
1014	3	0	Clever decor with lower false ceiling to distinguish the bar area.
1015	3	2	When I went in for dinner this Sunday, after a 2 month absence, I noticed their addition of table cloths, which really add to the ambiance and I noticed that their wine list has been expanded.
1016	3	2	This review is based on breakfast/brunch: I called on Saturday for a table the next day (knowing it was unlikely that I'd get one) and the reservations person told me that there were no tables available.
1017	3	2	We arrived at Crema at 7:50 and the hostess advised she had no record of my reservation.
1018	3	0	Portions enough for 2 meals.
1019	3	1	Fun atmosphere, good beer selection, but meals were skimpy portions on big plates and the service was weak - never had the same server/waitperson come back twice.
1020	3	1	not large portions - my boyfriend's entree looked more like an appetizer, and all we got out of the dinner was a $100 tab and hunger for more food.
1021	3	2	Try a traditional latin favorite like Arroz con pollo (yellow rice w/ chicken red bell pepper) but meat lovers should definitely not miss out on the churrasco!
1022	3	0	The point of dining here is to get several Tasting plates (two of us shared 5 @ $12/each and were quite full), and try as many of the dishes on the menu as possible.
1023	3	1	No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.
1024	3	2	The hostess was totally not accomadating, and even though there were empty tables they still didn't seat us!
1025	3	0	Could have gone to Pastis for a salad three times the size for the same price.
1026	3	0	If you've got the money and don't mind being packed in like sardines - then cozy on up to the Sushi Bar (much better than a table) and let Gari work his Omikase magic.
1027	3	0	So we said we would have a drink at the bar (the only redeaming quality or value in the whole place was the bartender and the big vodka sour she made me).
1028	3	2	Waitress was unenthusiastic and refilled my water only after I asked her to but did not refill my date's empty water glass?!?!?
1029	3	2	We were told by the front door hostess since we didn't have a reservation, it would be about 45mins for a table, but we could wait at the lounge and they would get us when our table was ready.
1030	3	2	4-Got attitude from the waitress at every moment she was at the table.
1031	3	0	The Scene An outing to this ski lodge-sized hot spot, with one of the city's most expansive and popular outdoor patios, feels more like a night spent at a fashion show than dinner at a restaurant--and not just because of the celebrity sightings.
1032	3	2	Very cheesy wanna be romantic decor and entertainment, but have some vodka and you want to come right out onto the dance floor and dance the night away to a mix of really bad russian and american disco music.
1033	3	0	Few styles of cooking place such an importance on texture--baby eels in a sizzling slick of oil, for example, is nudged just a shade away from pasta by the crackle of tiny bones under your teeth.
1034	3	0	The Scene Shun Lee Palace is popular with midtown locals, possibly because the upscale room means you can impress a client and have Chinese for lunch at the same time.
1035	3	2	this place was ok I guess since they have karaoke goin' on with a free shot if you sing.
1036	3	2	Food was ok, but not worth the 1 hour wait (we sat down an hour after our reservation time) If you are going to make people wait a LONG time, then at least build a bigger bar.
1037	3	2	There was a short wait for a table, which we spent at the bar, then we were seated on their patio.
1038	3	0	I read about this place in the Post, but never stepped foot in it I ordered a red velvet cake to be delivered to lOwer Manhattan; It got there, and the broads at the office raved about it!
1039	3	2	The mussles had be be a portion of maybe 8-9 mussles only and the gnocci were basically all garlic- garlic is just meant to be a condiment- way tooo much garlic.
1040	3	0	2 weeks ago, I decided to set up a birthday dinner in this establishment and was wary with the reviews I've read in City Search but it seems to be a perfect scene.
1041	3	0	When he mentioned that a pinot noir would be a decent match with two disparate plates of a first course (and the even further disparate second course- yes we informed him of our total meal choices PRIOR to our wine selection).
1042	3	2	At 1:15 we were still waiting for our plates!
1043	3	0	Our group of 8 had about five small plates that we thought were the best on the menu.
1044	3	0	In Short Take a quick trip to Maine at this classic lobster pound where the outdoor picnic tables are the prime seats in summertime.
1045	3	2	After waiting 40 minutes for a table and 30+ for our entrees, our waiter was distracted.
1046	3	2	I can only speak as a non-Indian, since we both come from an originally American palate, but Indian cuisine, both Northern and Southern, is my favorite non-Western cuisine, and I'm always on the prowl for something delicious and worth the price.
1047	3	2	: after ordering a bottle of wine (which was originally, inexplicably mistaken for 2 glasses of it), the (2) waitresses in charge of the outdoor space claimed that the bottle was right there in the only cooler used to service about 10 tables.
1048	3	2	better for dining with friends/significant others.
1049	3	1	If she was a bit more sophisticated, she wouldn't have been impressed with the list, but rather with the clientele and atmosphere.
1050	3	2	We were just settling the bill, when a waiter I can only assume held a controlling interest in the restaurant (else he would've been fired long ago) came to the table and demanded to know why someone (our friend who'd briefly left to use the restroom) had left her beer half-full.
1051	3	1	The Scene There's nothing fancy about this joint, where the line for takeout often dwarfs those huddled at the three patio-style tables.
1052	3	0	I came to have dinner with two of my girlfriends on saturday and had an awsome time.
1053	3	0	The prices were outrageous, but we assumed the quality would be commensurate, so we ordered.
1054	3	2	When her boyfriend told the host that she would like to keep her seat as it was, he grabbed a chair and slammed it down very hard on the floor.
1055	3	0	The coffee by the name of the place is delicious and although the space is a bit tight, it's a great place to chat, chill or simply enjoy a great cup of joe.
1056	3	1	I do not understand how this place can stay in business with its prices and quality of food.
1057	3	0	In the most beautiful ground floor brownstone setting.
1058	3	1	When I go out for dinner which is quite often, I have never encountered such rudeness from a waiter or owner as I did at this smoke filled, tight spaced, cash only restaurant.
1059	3	2	Also, overheard gent at the next table complaining to the manager about his food.
1060	3	2	The was very little if any seasoning on the meat, and the outsiside has nice sear marks and a rich taste.
1061	3	2	Our plates were taken before we finished eating and our waitress sent the hostess to tell us we had to leave to make room for the next table and that we had to pay before we left.
1062	3	0	The food was simple but exploded with flavor and the presentation was as if it was out of a cook book.
1063	3	2	In fact, you can't really say you've arrived in this town until you've scored a table here and made the pilgrimage to east Harlem for luscious pastas and chicken in vinegar and lemon.
1064	3	0	Though weekend nights and Sunday brunch draw the largest crowds, neighborhood residents master this vegan menu of quinoa-lentil cakes, seitan piccata, and sweet-potato pumpkin pie by popping in daily.
1065	3	2	The Server took the order and disappeared for the entire rest of the night until we had to stop him b/c the bus boy knocked over our entire bottle of red wine soaking the white table cloth, the seats and our business suits.
1066	3	1	In my opinion, the bar is not very well laid out, its narrow design makes it hard to meet a group for drinks.
1067	3	2	cool new cocktails, amazing apps, we were seated on Chefs Table for dinner ;) All ten of us were extremely comfortable, where the Chef came personally and we had special dishes that were pre-decided by my cousin for his party.
1068	3	2	We first got a table next to a VERY loud speaker and had no view, but the waiter was kind enough to move us when we asked.
1069	3	1	you might have made a reservation, but you will end up waiting for about an hour anyway, so hopefully you'll get a seat at the bar and won't have to stand around.
1070	3	2	but when tables began to clear up, it seemed polite to seat us comfortably in the dining area instead of having us twist our backs to talk, perched on bulky high chairs at the bar with no place to put our handbags (which the waiter happened to drop and expose contents later on).
1071	3	2	Without reservations on a Friday night at 8:30 I was promptly seated and given top-notch recommendations from both the host and my waiter.
1072	3	2	I could not believe how much food they brought out to the table!
1073	3	0	The drinks are very pricey and small, and the food is ok - but the portion size for the price is outrageous.
1074	3	0	Our server paid little attention to refilling our drinks, the runners brought the entrees out less than 1 minute after the appetizer, the server delivered another table's bill to us before we had even had entrees, and my partner's entree has a very noticable hair on his plate.
1075	3	0	The mint love letters and spaghettini primi we ordered as entrees were perfection.
1076	3	2	Great for those hungover mornings when you need a decent pint and delicious, homemade food that will tide you over for the whole day.
1077	3	0	the food sounded good enough on paper, with lots of clever names and interesting choices, but once we bit in, the dishes were all pretty bland.
1078	3	1	The portions were kid sized and we spent about $100 a person in cluding wine (4 of us).
1079	3	2	When I went for sunday brunch, not only was the food bland and cold, they didn't even bother to clear the plates once they brought the bill.
1080	3	1	The portions were so small that we still wanted to eat after dinner.
1081	3	2	I have never had a bad meal or service (on a couple of occasions I waited past my reservation time).
1082	3	0	The pot pie, pork chop and chicken were cleaned off the plates so well they didn't need washing.
1083	3	2	Waiter took our drink order and then we didn't see him for 15 minutes.
1084	3	2	It does get crowded with plenty of blue shirted cigar smoking wannabes, so make a reservation.
1085	3	2	Our waitress took our order and then NEVER came back to our table.
1086	3	2	The Scene This stylish, golden-hued noodle house spiffs up a dull stretch of Sixth Avenue with a crowd ranging from Japanese visitors to NYU students taking advantage of full-flavored, sustaining soups at bargain prices.
1087	3	0	It is so difficult to choose a favorite on the menu, because the bolognese, the salmon, the chicken with mushroom, and the telephono are all too good to rank.
1088	3	2	I made reservations one week in advance and although I had to change it at the last minute, the hostess was very accommodating and we got seated promptly upstairs overlooking the Buddha.
1089	3	2	Went with my father without a reservation, and the maitre d' was very nice and sat us within 15 minutes of our arrival - we had been told that the wait would be an hour (this may be unusual).
1090	3	2	The cooks in the front are very friendly and helpful.
1091	3	0	Id say a little better than most Thai Ive eaten, and the menu had an astounding selection, which isnt bad for such a reasonable price.
1092	3	2	However the manager, who refused to come to our table to discuss it, said we were wrong (through the poor waitress) and would not replace our bottle.
1093	3	2	The drinks were really good- albeit a bit weird served out of baby bottles.
1094	3	2	The brasserie-style menu remains relatively unchanged, featuring classic bistro choices like frisee salad with bacon, blue cheese and a poached egg, steak tartare, moules and steak frites, and various burgers and sandwiches.
1095	3	1	i got a steak special that was way overpriced ($12 more then the steak on the menu and no warning from the waitress) and it was cooked to the wrong temperature.
1096	3	2	This set off our critical eye: ceramic bowls having edges higher than the table votives hid the fact that the food was presented cafeteria-style; a rolling-eyed waiter pushing water; the awkward Italian menue gimmick; and the bill.
1097	3	2	I thought it was great, best service I've ever had in a long time.
1098	3	2	Was greeted and seated with no attitude from the host and hostess, despite no reservation.
1099	3	2	Although Nobu requires a 2-3 month advanced reservations, it's worth the wait!
1100	3	2	Be careful with the waiting list- the hostess skipped over our party on the list as we sat waiting for a table, for over an hour.
1101	3	2	We tried to get the manager who flatly refused to come to our table and discuss the problem with us.
1102	3	0	Based on the menu prices, the value of the buffet is made up before you even hit the buffet with the appetizers that are served to the table.
1103	3	2	Our last experience: Waiting for a table at the bar (we always make reservations), the bartender ignored us until my husband intervened with one of the owners.
1104	3	1	I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
1105	3	2	Upon walking in and noticing the exposed red brick wall and the white tableclothes and and huge rack of various wines behind the bar, I felt like I was in a truly authentic Italian restaurant.
1106	3	1	From the outside this place looks cute, however, once inside loud as a disco!
1107	3	0	The portions were very big for appetizers (calimari and fried zucchini) but average for the entrees (chicken marsala, spaghetti w/ meatballs) and very expensive of course.
1108	3	2	Other than making the grill flame at the beginning our hibatchi chef didnt put on much of a show - no flipping stuff into is hat or our plates - so if that is your thing go to Benihani.
1109	3	2	Check out the little room with the red seats and candles and get a green dragon saketini - it's worth the NYC cocktail price ($14).
1110	3	2	The waiter accidently spilled water on our table, and the manager checked up on our meal periodically and offered us a free after diner drink.
1111	3	2	When the spastic waiter finally stopped by our table, we told him we were going to order everything at once b/c we were getting pretty hungry.
1112	3	2	My mother and I had our chairs bumped over a dozen times by hasty waiters.
1113	3	2	However, when our waitress realized her faux pas, an extra glass of wine was sent to our table and all was forgiven.
1114	3	2	overall the food we ordered (pancit luglug, chicken adobo, romy's ribs, lumpia shanghai, a bowl of green soup that resembles the polyjuice potion harry potter drank) was not screaming with taste.
1115	3	1	Our food took so long to be served that we nearly missed our curtain.
1116	3	0	They brought fresh naan to the table as well as a kind of crepe filled with potatoes that was cooked on a griddle set up by the window.
1117	3	2	Went to Gallaghers for the first time on a Saturday night, had no problem getting reservations, great staff-great service.
1118	3	2	Odd, traditional and clashing decor will only detract from your experience if the square box layout or perma-draft through the pane glass door doesn't get you first.
1119	3	2	sort of crouched in a chair, leaning over a table, while someone did that obnoxious karate chop sort of thing on her back for way too long.
1120	3	0	There is always a fun and friendly crowd at the bar, mostly locals, if you just want to come by for happy hour.
1121	3	0	From the space shuttle trip entrance to mars, to the molecular regenerator exit to earth, it was all an exquisite dining experience.
1122	3	2	Service was fine and the food delivered in reasonable time given the crowd, but for the price I was disappointed.
1123	3	2	No bread basket for the table, the server came around with a basket and we each got 1 piece of bread.
1124	3	2	The baked penne came out in a small bowl, burnt with barley any sauce for $18.
1125	3	2	Waited for a table, got disgusting martinis at the bar, and sat down.
1126	3	2	If you order the platters all of your typical Indian side items are included so it is a good value.
1127	3	0	AND you can still smoke at the outermost area of the patio - the wait staff can't technically serve you there because of the smoking, but if you don't mind walking to the bar to place an order (I don't), it's a great solution for smokers.
1128	3	2	The food is pretty good, but the staff would rather be anywhere than waiting tables at Maison.
1129	3	0	Got the scoop on this new hot spot and decided to give it shot for a client dinner.
1130	3	2	The service is smart and though they can be overwhelmed with the crowds, does a good job.
1131	3	2	Even if you're just a middling junior exec, staff service makes you feel like a board member.
1132	3	2	Tried to get a table during restaurant week but there was an over an hour wait.
1133	3	2	71 Irving's coffee is not only delicious but also consistently delicious.
1134	3	2	In Short The few window-front tables fill quickly, but most customers prefer not to linger in the nondescript space, in favor of taking their Thai food to go, or phoning in for delivery.
1135	3	2	I love it at lunch time, less expensive, excellent food, awesome people-watching (Hi, Regis who is right next to our table) and really nice and airy in the summertime when they open the windows.
1136	3	2	The sandwiches from the take out window are delicious too.
1137	3	2	To top it off, when we mentioned it to our lovely waitress, she responded as though it was no big deal along with Well now you know for the next time.
1138	3	2	45 minutes later our less-than-stellar pizza and their even less-than-stellar gnoccho was dropped at the table; no explanation or apology or attempt to acknowledge the ridiculous wait.
1139	3	2	Once the food came, we could not eat because we did not have the little plates for the soy sauce.
1140	3	2	This has to be the HUGEST steak I've ever seen and the value here is OUTRAGEOUS.
1141	3	0	I live about a 1/2 block from Westway and when I want consistantly good food, big portions, great fast service and a step above your average diner food I go there!
1142	3	2	Instead, Yasuda's swarm of waiters and waitresses hovered incessantly overhead, seizing any opportunity to fill a glass, reorganize the table, ask if we were done, and of course clear us out of there in under 80 min.
1143	3	0	The Food The French-Belgian menu is small, and everything on it is satisfyingly savory, such as a simple pot of mussels in a choice of sauces (beer and bacon, creamy mushroom, or white wine-and-garlic broth); beef stewed with beer and prunes; and a juicy croque monsieur.
1144	3	1	Self-important people, please stay at home and cook and dump as much parmesan on as you like.
1145	3	2	They have little booths if you want a little privacy w/ your date~ and they have large tables for families and groups.
1146	3	1	There are decent selections if you are a seafood person, but not a lot if you aren't!
1147	3	0	I was at Son Cubano a few months ago, and although i was only at the bar (without prior reservations which are a must), i had an awesome time.
1148	3	2	The menu was nicely sized with five small plates, eight appetizers and seven entrees.
1149	3	2	The Scene This vintage Cuban diner, with white acrylic tables, soft Spanish music humming pleasantly in the background and regulars casually hugging the counter, serves some of the cheapest, tastiest fare in the area.
1150	3	1	He, however, gave great service even though he just brought our food since they didn't have a runner.
1151	3	1	No matter what you order, you're almost certain to get so much food you'll be leaving with a doggie bag.
1152	3	0	The happy hour crowd at the bar was mostly just out of worker blowing off steam.
1153	3	0	The decor has not quite made the transition--some really nice artifacts are still there, but there are several layers of different remodeling efforts visible.
1154	3	0	big chunk of meat(beef short rib).
1155	3	2	Took the waiter 10 minutes to get to our table, and another 15 minutes until the coffee I ordered arrived.
1156	3	2	We made reservations for 6pm on Friday and it was not necessary BUT the place got packed really quick around 7-8pm.
1157	3	0	Besides, vegetarian or not, there are always ways to liven up food without compromising the healthy aspect.
1158	3	1	You wanna wait a hour for a cramped table to eat mom's macaroni and cheese?
1159	3	2	Zippier palates share sesame-fried lobster spring rolls, shrimp dumplings with citrus soy, and inventive maki, like the smoky and sweet filet mignon-pineapple variety.
1160	3	2	do not take the reservation at 8pm to begin with, if in reality the management knows that it will be impossible to seat at that time.
1161	3	2	go there and get really good food, just don't expect to get out of there quickly and when the server comes to your table ask for everything you'll be needing for the rest of the evening.
1162	3	0	I met five of my friends for dinner at Blockheads last Friday night and had a good time.
1163	3	2	The only thing I didn't like was the bread that came to the table before dinner.
1164	3	1	The ambience is stunning and the food is really good, but the portions are RIDICULOUSLY small.
1165	3	2	I had oysters for my appetizer and the Turbot with a delicate creamy lemon sauce with a hint of dill for dinner.
1166	3	1	fish was fresh enough, but the quality was only so-so (the salmon was especially sinewy).
1167	3	2	From the opera playing in the background, to Emilio, the owner wishing everyone a good meal, this should be the highest rated Italian restaurant in the city.
1168	3	0	They bring over your favorite beverage before you sit down and while dining you listen to a killer jukebox.
1169	3	2	The server came by only once to pour additional wine for the table; the rest of the time, we had to fish the bottle out of the two-table communal bucket ourselves.
1170	3	2	If you happen to catch it when no one else is there, sit down at the table, get a tea and try the coconut cake.
1171	3	2	Staff dissappeared after 2PM and we had to send a search party to find our waitress who was parked at a table upstairs reading a newspaper.
1172	3	1	The restaurant is small so ask for seating in the front upstairs (the back, where we were sitting was incredibly hot) or on the first floor.
1173	3	0	The smell was heavenly, and the appearance was great, but the cheese was a little too salty and heavy.
1174	3	2	So we showed up with our reservations and even though the place stayed pretty empty throughout the night, they seated us right next to the swinging kitchen doors.
1175	3	2	If people are late, you could lose your reservation and/or the staff does pressure you to start ordering even if your whole party hasnt arrived.
1176	3	0	The portions for the entrees did make up for it.
1177	3	1	The line is long, but the staff keeps it moving and usually everyone is friendly.
1178	3	2	The place was busy and had a bohemian feel.
1179	3	1	Yuckity Yuck Yuck  The Burritos were horrible but the Sangria was decent.
1180	3	1	Other reviews complain about portions, it's a TASTING menu not a Time's Square buffet.
1181	3	2	Dylan Prime is one of an increasingly small number of restaurants in NYC that take reservations for large groups.
1182	3	2	who seemed honestly offended that we asked why our table was 45 minutes late; a cold cafeteria room that was clearly designed to intimidate; and haute chinese food that was over-salted to make up for the lack of flavor.
1183	3	2	Instead of doing so, the manager came to our table and told us he'd be happy to take our orders off if we didn't like the way he ran his restaurant.
1184	3	2	The atmosphere is warmly dim and inviting - if you make a reservation, ask for a corner both for extra coziness!
1185	3	1	When we arrived there was no free table so we waited at the bar for quite a long time.
1186	3	2	Well on a friday or sat, i think this place should take reservations as it gets pretty busy.
1187	3	1	The Scene This cosmopolitan cousin of the legendary Harry's Bar in Venice is frequented by a wealthy and insouciant crowd, the types who don't bother looking at menu prices when they order.
1188	3	2	Crowded waiting area in entrance forced you to sweat out the wait for a table while standing over other diners.
1189	3	2	The whole time we were waiting the hostess kept talking to us, telling us we wouldn't lose our reservation, and even gave us free blue margarita shots!
1190	3	0	The kids really enjoyed their food and the value on the kids menu is good.
1191	3	2	We decided to share order of filet mignon for the table because there was just not enough food.
1192	3	2	seated promptly; while waitstaff seemed confused as to what they should be doing (one actually looked at my partner's mojito and asked if she had 'put her dinner in the glass'), our waiter appeared experienced.
1193	3	2	Small dishes, a bit pricier than you'd pay in Miami or LA, but the atomsphere is on the sexy side (however pared down) and its cozy.
1194	3	2	The food was scrumptious-not the usual wedding.
1195	3	0	Though the menu includes some unorthodox offerings (a peanut butter roll, for instance), the classics are pure and great--we've never had better sushi anywhere, including Japan.
1196	3	2	the waitress came to ask me how my NY Strip was, and I could not give her an answer b/c no one gave me a steak knife.
1197	3	2	We were told by the hostess to make sure we were on time for our reservation, which we were, but then they kept us waiting for 15 minutes when we got there.
1198	3	1	During the weekend nights, the crowd is full of 20 somethings (in which a few look much younger) and is almost Coyote Ugly style where ladies are dancing all over the bar.
1199	3	0	Choices are standard and plentiful: omelettes and egg dishes, pancakes, bagels, muffins, croissants, mini-doughnuts, cookies, etc.
1200	3	2	Even with reservations, we had to wait 20 minutes until our server came to take our order, then waited an HOUR 10 minutes for our food!
1201	3	2	When I got the bill and saw I was billed separately for each cup of coffee, I asked the waiter if he could do anything since the menu doesn't even list drinks and the manager said no.
1202	3	0	After being seated by a very kind, but quite stressed, young lady, we took in the room and menu.
1203	3	1	If I had a car, I'd go there more often, but I live 35 blocks away and don't trust carrying pastries home on the bumpy crowded B41 busline.
1204	3	2	I've heard that if you sit at the sushi bar, you can request rolls, but if you're at a table, the rolls are just the fish wrapped in seaweed with rice (which is still good, but I really love creative rolls).
1205	3	1	The Scene Rows of glass-topped, red-tableclothed tables stretch back to the rear of the brightly lit space, whose white walls hold a few seafaring decorations--a boat painting here, a captain's wheel there.
1206	3	1	Service was a tad spotty, but the food was VERY good and the noise never detracted from the dining experience.
1207	3	0	Downstairs, with the lighter menu, and uncomfortable seating, is only worthwhile if people watching and the energy of the bar scene is more important to you than the food.
1208	3	0	After the bar, they sat us on the side with the wine room with a nice view of everything.
1209	3	2	Anyway, I went down on a Wednesday night to see if they had a long wait and the hostess said they had a table to accomodate my party.
1210	3	2	i've had better mashed potatoes from a box, and the vegetables were soaked in oil.
1211	3	2	There were a few moments during the tasting menu that left me speechless, such as the shrimp in cream sauce, toro with foam, foie gras custard, eggplant in miso and a foie gras kobe beef filet fried ball that brought me to tears.
1212	3	2	The place was bustling at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night- we arrived earlier than our reservation and got situated at the bar.
1213	3	2	Our waiter was well versed with the menu and provided us with great service, he didn't hover over the table as some servers tend to do in high end restaurants.
1214	3	2	Roof: very nice space (although I know 5 other rooftop bars just as good), but the crowd was a bunch of posers and the owner was a tool.
1215	3	2	7A is open 24/7 and is great for lunch, brunch or a late night visit after partying all night.
1216	3	1	The portions are miniscule and the size of an entree could be half-and appetizer if even that large.
1217	3	2	We had a reservation and 2 of us showed up on time and notified the hostess that we were there but the other 2 were running a few minutes late.
1218	3	2	My friend and I did have to wait a few minutes for a table, but only because Amanda Hesser (the new NY Times food critic) showed up and, obviously, needed a copious level of attention from the greetings staff.
