54	1	1	This should have been done in a back room - away from customers.

80	1	0	Get your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings.
81	1	1	We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it.
82	1	1	Something about them being busy with holiday party's.

94	1	0	Sexy.
95	1	0	I will have to say, this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite.

97	1	0	Even with John's and Joe's around the corner, this place will make a name for itself.
98	1	0	Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.
99	1	0	I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.

153	1	0	Went here last night and had a pleasant experience.
154	1	0	We parked on the block of Nina's the place looked nice, with people obviously enjoying their pizzas.
155	1	1	While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.
156	1	1	It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.

340	1	1	Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (I happen to live in Inwood).
341	1	1	Don't waste your time, or money!!
342	1	1	They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.
343	1	1	We just ate at Kai and were disapointed.
344	1	0	This was a great surprise.
345	1	0	It was wonderful.
346	1	1	I just don't understand all the hype...
347	1	1	I don't get it either.

357	1	0	I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.

359	1	1	Please save yourself the frustration.
360	1	0	I was pleasantly suprised.
361	1	1	Look elsewhere.
362	1	1	I seriously doubt I will ever dine at Jimmy's Bronx, or for that matter, Jimmy's Uptown, again.

364	1	0	Worth a visit.
365	1	1	A real dissapointment.

371	1	1	We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant.
372	1	0	I love this place!
373	1	1	it is not consistent.
374	1	1	However, I was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling.
375	1	0	I recommend it!
376	1	0	I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well.
377	1	0	Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker, we were seated at a table with one of the best view!
378	1	1	When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check.
379	1	0	Yeah, it's that good.
380	1	0	I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced.
381	1	0	My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a delicious, new summer menu at Artisanal last night.
382	1	0	I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.
383	1	0	I have been going back again and again.
384	1	0	Overall, excellent restaurant!
385	1	1	When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
386	1	0	I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it!
387	1	0	This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.
388	1	1	But too far east!
389	1	0	Satisfying.
390	1	0	Highly Highly Highly recommended!
391	1	0	This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv.
392	1	1	now if they could only get a toaster.
393	1	0	You will find yourself returning quite often.
394	1	1	Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place.
395	1	0	You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill.
396	1	1	It appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows.
397	1	1	The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.
398	1	1	A million better places to go in the city.
399	1	0	I love it.
400	1	0	If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.
401	1	1	We had reservations at 9pm, but was not seated until 10:15pm.

419	1	0	I've been several times and am totally smitten.
420	1	1	Terrible experience.

433	1	0	Seriously, this place kicks ass.
434	1	0	I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
435	1	0	THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
436	1	1	However, I do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant.
437	1	0	I will be returning.
438	1	0	Nice place though.
439	1	0	Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!
440	1	0	Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20.
441	1	1	But WARNING: to all those that use this site be weary, be very weary of recommendations.
442	1	0	We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night.
443	1	0	Try it side by side and there's no comparison.

455	1	1	Horrible.
456	1	0	Its worth the wait though.
457	1	0	What an amazing meal and experience!
458	1	0	and never strayed.
459	1	1	This place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else.
460	1	0	Big thumbs up!
461	1	0	I loved it.
462	1	0	Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn.

474	1	0	I take all my NYC guests to VT's.
475	1	1	Even with the prix fixe pricing, this restaurant is not worth it.
476	1	0	Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off, like in this case.
477	1	0	However, their popularity has yet to slow down, and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation.
478	1	0	I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites.
479	1	0	I LOVED THE SHOWS.
480	1	0	My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food.
481	1	0	Give it a try and enjoy.

483	1	0	if your into thai..you cannot miss this great restaurant.
484	1	0	Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!
485	1	0	I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city.
486	1	0	for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location!

488	1	0	I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed.
489	1	0	I have had so many dinners here and it's always been perfect - on a date with my husband, with my mom, with girlfriends and larger groups.
490	1	1	I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this, but the second visit was even worse.
491	1	0	Unbelievable.
492	1	0	A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!
493	1	0	As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling.
494	1	0	The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.
495	1	0	My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.
496	1	1	This restaurant was way overhyped.
497	1	1	I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.
498	1	0	Now at the top of our list, Del Frisco's Steakhouse.
499	1	0	I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.
500	1	1	This was the worst dining experience I've ever had.
501	1	0	I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
502	1	1	Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair.
503	1	0	I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough.
504	1	0	In fact, you can't miss it.
505	1	0	I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great.
506	1	1	I don't get it, what's so special about Prune ?
507	1	0	I'd definitely recommend this little place.
508	1	0	Again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.
509	1	0	Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe's to eat here.
510	1	0	I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more!
511	1	1	Get it together.
512	1	0	The eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce.
513	1	0	In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch, this place is great.
514	1	1	In fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and I couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible.
515	1	1	If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.
516	1	0	A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town.
517	1	0	I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!
518	1	1	The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in Chinese.
519	1	0	Enjoy!!!
520	1	0	Kudos to Po!
521	1	1	Never again!
522	1	1	For Park avenue I expected so much more.
523	1	1	So rude.
524	1	1	There are much better places in NY with better prices.
525	1	0	Everything is delicious, though, my gf and I come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted!
526	1	0	Still, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best dining experiences.
527	1	0	Overall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.
528	1	0	I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.
529	1	0	I plan on stopping by next week as well.
530	1	0	As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city.
531	1	0	We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food.
532	1	0	Highly recommended to all!
533	1	0	highly recommended.

535	1	0	It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC.
536	1	0	I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.
537	1	1	If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I'd go out in Manhattan.

539	1	0	This is a fun restaurant to go to.
540	1	0	Bravissimo !!
541	1	0	Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch!
542	1	0	We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience!!!
543	1	0	Found service above average, but that could be because we were 13 of us.
544	1	0	When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back, in a veyr good sense.
545	1	0	It's to die for!
546	1	1	Overall a disappointing experience for that price category.
547	1	0	You will be satisfied.
548	1	0	Another great place to take out-of-towners!
549	1	1	We were less than impressed.
550	1	1	A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?
551	1	1	but still my date was bad
552	1	0	Would definitely go back again.
553	1	0	I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.

558	1	0	Having been a long time Ess-a-Bagel fan, I was surpised to find myself return time and time again to Murray's.
559	1	0	Go for it!
560	1	0	Highly recommended.
561	1	0	You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.
562	1	0	I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.
563	1	0	Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to Price Ratio).
564	1	0	Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.
565	1	0	Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
566	1	1	Not a great place for family or general dining.
567	1	1	I was wrong.
568	1	1	No plans to return anytime soon.
569	1	0	I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine.
570	1	1	I just do not understand what the fuss is all about.
571	1	0	We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.
572	1	1	For an untrendy rip-off- eat here.
573	1	0	I can't wait to go back.
574	1	1	I HATE HATE HATE this place.

576	1	0	Wonderful!
577	1	0	Go hungry and enjoy.
578	1	0	This place is worth an one-hour drive.
579	1	0	All I can say is WOW!
580	1	0	So all I'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I've ever been to.
581	1	1	We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food.
582	1	1	The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!
583	1	1	wont come back again for sure!
584	1	1	After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table.
585	1	0	Bon appettite!!
586	1	0	La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.
587	1	0	A great addition to Smith Street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots.
588	1	1	We spent $200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed.
589	1	0	It is simply amazing.
590	1	1	I liked this place the first time but doubt I will ever return.
591	1	1	Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
592	1	0	This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced.
593	1	0	Bravo, Blue Hill!
594	1	0	Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.
595	1	1	This place is to be avoided.
596	1	1	My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who don't know what they are doing.
597	1	0	I will definetly be going back.
598	1	0	I'm saving up for my next visit.
599	1	1	Amma is nothing special.
600	1	0	Worth it for a special occasion, or any time!
601	1	0	I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady.
602	1	0	Definitely a once a year treat that I look forward to around the holidays!
603	1	0	A defitely must visit.
604	1	0	great experience overall.
605	1	1	I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.
606	1	0	Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!
607	1	1	Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude.
608	1	0	20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other.
609	1	0	I live in the neightborhood and am a regular.
610	1	0	IT IS WHAT MODERN CUISINE IS ALL ABOUT.
611	1	0	In any event, even though its a bit on the pricey side, we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back.
612	1	0	I definitely will go back.
613	1	0	I've never been disappointed.
614	1	0	My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed.
615	1	0	I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons.
616	1	0	For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, I don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.
617	1	0	Beautiful experience.
618	1	0	If you can handle that, it's a great place for a business dinner, fun with friends or simply a table for 2.
619	1	0	When my husband and go there, we spend $60.00 (have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more) I can't say any more, it a place you'll never forget If you never go, you'll miss A Meal of your life time
620	1	1	The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead.
621	1	0	If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.
622	1	0	Joe's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up.
623	1	0	I have never had anything like it!
624	1	1	It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food.
625	1	0	I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys  fine cuisine at reasonable prices.
626	1	0	This is, by far, my favorite restaurant in NYC and I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more often!
627	1	0	THE FRANKENSTEIN SHOW WAS THE BEST.
628	1	1	As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst.

634	1	0	I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!
635	1	1	and we were thouroughly disapointed.
636	1	0	This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.
637	1	0	Our teenage kids love it, too.
638	1	0	You guys are awesome!
639	1	0	I loved this place!!
640	1	1	Avoid at all costs.

652	1	1	Everything that happened was not even up to mediocre.
653	1	0	I've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I've never been disappointed.
654	1	0	Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day.
655	1	0	This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples.
656	1	0	Another welcome addition to the neighborhood.
657	1	1	Not only would I not recommend Jimmy's restaurants to friends, I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but.
658	1	1	Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.
659	1	0	As a long-time patron of Mamoun's, I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city.
660	1	0	Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.

872	1	1	Actually, everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed.
873	1	0	Best Chinese on the Upper East, prompt delivery, good value.

876	1	0	You feel like you made it to New York when you eat here.

883	1	0	Really Lovely dining experience in the midst of buzzing midtown area.
884	1	1	Maybe it's that most of Dumont's patrons are younger and have lower expectations, but I cannot recommend Dumont.

886	1	0	This is the best unknown restaurant in and around New York.

888	1	0	It's a great find in Astoria.
889	1	1	It's always quiet because it's awful.
890	1	0	I have to say the place was awesome.
891	1	0	The restaurant could use a little paint, but all in all a great sushi place!
892	1	0	The decoration was feeling like we was on the Cairo, actually the street is part of that adventure.
893	1	0	My friends and I go once a week (minimum, we live in the area) and everytime can't resist walking out ready to burst.
894	1	0	Not only is this the best Thai restaurant I have been to, but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine.

899	1	0	good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine.
900	1	0	Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here.
901	1	1	I don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable.
902	1	1	We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this wasn't a place we'd return to.
903	1	0	I'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu!
904	1	0	I just had my first visit to this place and can't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu.
905	1	1	I asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter.
906	1	0	I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry- interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat.
