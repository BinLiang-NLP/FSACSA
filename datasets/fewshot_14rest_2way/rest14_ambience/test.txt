0	3	0	The design and atmosphere is just as good.
1	3	1	Secondly, on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume.
2	3	0	All the money went into the interior decoration, none of it went to the chefs.
3	3	1	The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.
4	3	0	Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast.

13	3	0	First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.
14	3	0	I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.
15	3	1	They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service.
16	3	0	The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant.
17	3	0	Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza.
18	3	1	It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone's living room.
19	3	0	Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale Italian decor.
20	3	0	Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.
21	3	1	Looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is).
22	3	0	Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price.
23	3	0	Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York.
24	3	0	Ambiance and music funky, which I enjoy.
25	3	0	I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.
26	3	0	Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.
27	3	1	Granted the space is smaller than most, it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants.
28	3	0	I love the atmorphere @ peep!
29	3	1	It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.
30	3	0	The environment is romantic, but the food is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could.
31	3	1	A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.
32	3	0	The service, wine selection, ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition.
33	3	0	It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.
34	3	0	I felt as though I were eating in Paris.
35	3	0	I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service.
36	3	0	All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere.
37	3	0	Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere.
38	3	1	Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.
39	3	0	Not pretentious and very economical.
40	3	1	The noise level was unbearable, conversation impossible.
41	3	0	The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon.
42	3	0	Decor is nice and minimalist, food simple yet very well presented and cooked, and the wine list matches the food very well.
43	3	0	The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.
44	3	0	When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.
45	3	0	The establishment scores big points in presentation and style.
46	3	0	The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints, and has a bar which deserves a mention.
47	3	0	good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
48	3	0	I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful!
49	3	0	Otherwise, this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere.
50	3	1	The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant, so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here.
51	3	0	The decor is dark, cool and soothing, while the food's presentation is spectacular, considering the low prices.
52	3	0	The setting is casual and romantic.
53	3	0	Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.
54	3	1	The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.
55	3	0	The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.
56	3	0	Great people watching as others do the same to you.
57	3	1	While we thoroughly enjoyed the food, it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation.
58	3	1	First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.
59	3	0	The second you walk through the heavy vault like door, with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime.
60	3	1	Big and gawky on the outside.
61	3	0	While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.
62	3	1	The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look.
63	3	1	If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.
64	3	0	Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal.
65	3	1	The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly.
66	3	0	I love this cozy around the way Rest.
67	3	1	The place is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.
68	3	0	Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.
69	3	0	The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great.
70	3	0	The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.
71	3	0	Check out the secret back room.
72	3	0	It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar...
73	3	0	I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices, great atmosphere, good service and a wonderful wine list.
74	3	1	I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again.
75	3	0	With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room.
76	3	1	I was a little leary about Mary's at first - it's small, crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but I'm glad I finally tried it.
77	3	0	The characters really make for an enjoyable experience.
78	3	0	It's constantly open, catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).
79	3	0	Great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!).
80	3	0	While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better.
81	3	1	I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive.
82	3	0	We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me.
83	3	1	The food is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing place to go.
84	3	0	Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!
85	3	1	Behind this counter, two men are squeezed in.
86	3	0	The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.
87	3	0	The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.
88	3	0	It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
89	3	1	Now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.
90	3	1	However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.
91	3	0	After dinner, take your date to the HUGE dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in NY.
92	3	0	I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.
93	3	0	Located at the end of a magnificent block.
94	3	0	Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.
95	3	0	They don't walk around with the trays of Dim Sum.
96	3	0	We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.
97	3	0	Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!
98	3	1	There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times.
99	3	0	Don't waste money on decor.
100	3	0	They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?
101	3	1	While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.
102	3	0	It's a shame that a nice, convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service.
103	3	0	The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.
104	3	0	The place was quiet and delightful.
105	3	0	The prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village.
106	3	1	Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.
107	3	0	The atmosphere is great!!!
108	3	0	It can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it.
109	3	1	Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable.
110	3	0	It's like you are transported to the Italian countryside, very romantic and filled with antiques.
111	3	0	Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor.
112	3	1	But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar' or 'pub'.
113	3	1	I don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.
114	3	0	I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine!!!
115	3	0	Haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service.
116	3	0	Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.
117	3	0	Very romantic fires - I've literally spent hours at Lanterna, drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience.
118	3	0	Always a nice crowd, but never loud.
119	3	0	This place, however, has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above-average.
120	3	1	This place is incredibly tiny.
121	3	0	I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.
122	3	0	It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence.
123	3	1	The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud.
124	3	1	I was with a party of 7 (close but not next the the front doors) and we were eating with our coats on.
125	3	0	A very inviting restaurant, with friendly service.
126	3	0	THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden.
127	3	0	The ceiling is amazing!
128	3	1	The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.
129	3	0	Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.
130	3	1	Oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.
131	3	1	Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.
132	3	0	THR AT MOSHPHERE IS COMPACT, MODERN, YET COZY.
133	3	1	Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs, so be aware.
134	3	1	Too cold to enjoy.
135	3	1	So, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out.
136	3	0	Chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the decor is great.
137	3	0	Good, dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch.
138	3	0	Great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap.
139	3	0	Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.
140	3	0	Because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.
141	3	0	Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.
142	3	0	The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.
143	3	1	It is about FOOD and Ambiance, and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine.
144	3	0	The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
145	3	0	Great food, great lay out and awesome service.
146	3	0	I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.
147	3	0	The food was amazing, the service was so attentive and personable, and how about that ambience!
148	3	0	This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg, and will impress whoever you bring there.
149	3	1	It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks.
150	3	1	You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation.
151	3	0	We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.
152	3	0	The location is perfect.
153	3	0	The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied  by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10!
154	3	0	If your visiting, you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's in Time Sq...
155	3	0	LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris.
156	3	0	Spice is sleek, modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet.
157	3	0	Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff.
158	3	0	Very affordable and excellent ambient!
159	3	0	Its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests.
160	3	1	Why do people rave about the ambience.
161	3	0	The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
162	3	0	Ambience is delightful, service impeccable.
163	3	0	Service was excellent, and the AC worked very well too (thank God, it was hot!).
164	3	0	The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.
165	3	0	Great atmoshere and worth every bit.
166	3	0	Excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service.
167	3	0	A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts.
168	3	0	Great vibe, lots of people.
169	3	1	Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.
170	3	0	A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer.
171	3	0	The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service.
172	3	0	Great food (spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry), very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom.
173	3	0	Romantic if you want it to be (brightly lit).
174	3	0	Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker, we were seated at a table with one of the best view!
175	3	1	The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside.
176	3	0	In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!
177	3	0	It's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool design, awsome drinks and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar...
178	3	0	It's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even.
179	3	0	Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat.
180	3	1	Don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few tables and they are always full.
181	3	0	The staff is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world!
182	3	0	This place is cool enough to be in the East Village, but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris.
183	3	0	No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.
184	3	0	This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater.
185	3	1	The decor is really blah, and not at all hip or happening.
186	3	0	Having discovered Ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in.
187	3	1	Just don't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there.
188	3	0	To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting.
189	3	1	at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous.
190	3	0	We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed, reminds me of my grandfather, its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire.
191	3	0	The place was nice and calm.
192	3	1	The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.
193	3	0	My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails, the chill decor, and the decent sushi.
194	3	1	The food was below average, the service was pathetic, there was no ambience at all.
195	3	0	I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS.
196	3	0	Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.
197	3	0	Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time.
198	3	0	However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.
199	3	1	When we left at 8:00 PM, it was packed and noisy.
200	3	0	Decor is nice though service can be spotty.
201	3	0	Really cool stauff inside.
202	3	0	While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive, the menu has been overhauled.
203	3	0	The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great.
204	3	1	Of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways?
205	3	0	Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC.
206	3	1	Like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes, a busy restaurant may require you to wait.
207	3	0	Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.
208	3	0	It's a small cute restaurant.
209	3	0	Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.
210	3	1	Restaurant was dirty and unkempt.
211	3	0	You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind, Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting.
212	3	0	The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited.
213	3	0	Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.
214	3	0	Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor.
215	3	0	Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.
216	3	1	Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.
217	3	0	Everything is excellent, the menu is quite extensive, and you eat with a view on both sides of the city.
218	3	1	Here's to the fake fish tanks too...
219	3	0	The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad.
220	3	0	we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute.
221	3	0	The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
222	3	0	Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.
223	3	0	If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
224	3	1	Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.
225	3	0	Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot.
226	3	0	Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
227	3	0	This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive.
228	3	0	I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.
229	3	1	Zero ambiance to boot.
230	3	1	Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.
231	3	0	Everything looks great, the drinks, the decor, the food, even the people.
232	3	0	Good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese vibe.
233	3	0	However, their popularity has yet to slow down, and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation.
234	3	0	Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch.
235	3	0	The view is spectacular, and the food is great.
236	3	1	A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks.
237	3	0	I LOVED THE SHOWS.
238	3	1	The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge.
239	3	0	The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.
240	3	0	However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!
241	3	1	I think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic.
242	3	0	I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.
243	3	1	It cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.
244	3	0	The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.
245	3	0	A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town.
246	3	1	The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.
247	3	1	A little crowded but they move that line really fast!
248	3	0	The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.
249	3	0	The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date.
250	3	0	Very neighborhoody, very quick and sufficient.
251	3	1	And I could do without the cigar smoke.
252	3	0	The ambience is very calm and quiet.
253	3	0	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.
254	3	1	For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more.
255	3	0	We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food.
256	3	1	Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries.
257	3	0	Service is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens.
258	3	1	If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I'd go out in Manhattan.
259	3	0	Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city.
260	3	0	This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!
261	3	0	A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.
262	3	1	Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.
263	3	0	Cute and decorative.
264	3	1	I know this is the case in many nyc eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable.
265	3	0	Sure, the setting is nice.
266	3	0	Some of the finest latin women you'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy's.
267	3	0	I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.
268	3	1	The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired, but the food is very good.
269	3	0	So, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious.
270	3	0	There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.
271	3	0	While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.
272	3	0	I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine.
273	3	0	His wife Tanya, the hostess, completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious.
274	3	0	But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
275	3	0	You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.
276	3	0	The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.
277	3	0	This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.
278	3	0	The place is sleek, modern and playfull and i will return again frequently.

283	3	0	This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
284	3	0	The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).

286	3	0	PERFECT FOR DATES!

292	3	0	Jimmy's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx.
293	3	0	Nice ambiance, nice little bar, good bartender, Francois, and good service.
294	3	1	Decor leaves something to be desired.
295	3	0	Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food.
296	3	0	Oh yes, and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, I would love to know where they obtained.
297	3	0	The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.
298	3	1	The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.

301	3	0	THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.

303	3	0	This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside.
304	3	0	This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.
305	3	1	You will pay a lot for the decore, but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY.
306	3	0	great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...
307	3	0	While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way, the food was insultingly horrible.
308	3	1	Despite the fact that the space is large, they've overcrowded the floor with tables.
309	3	1	The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.
310	3	0	There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.
311	3	0	If you're looking for a place to sit down, have a drink and conversations with friends, go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls (hot).
312	3	1	While the room is not particularly comfortable, once you're seated you'll forget about everything except what's on your plate.
313	3	1	I've lived in NYC all my life and had never before seen so many waterbugs in one place (except in a really bad dream).
314	3	0	The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal, but some dishes are quite good, such as the eggplant parmesan, veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca.
315	3	0	If it isn't for the food (A+++), it must be the service or the ambience.
316	3	0	I like the ambience, it's very dark and original.
317	3	0	Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant.
318	3	1	Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy.
319	3	0	It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.
320	3	1	Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken.
321	3	1	My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!
322	3	0	The staff makes you feel at home, the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL!
323	3	1	The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.

334	3	0	The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the service could have been better.
335	3	1	This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers, right off of Pell St (barber's alley) in Chinatown.
336	3	0	Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.
337	3	0	The food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second!
338	3	1	From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed.
339	3	1	It is LOUD, HOT and DARK.
340	3	0	This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.
341	3	0	Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.

343	3	0	Decor is charming.
344	3	0	Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax.
345	3	1	While this can hardly be called a restaurant, it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten: $4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees.
346	3	0	This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC, it's wonderful, and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights.
347	3	0	If you are in a big group, this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here.
348	3	0	I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service.
349	3	1	And everytime I go there's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front.
350	3	0	They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent.
351	3	0	Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch!
352	3	1	The restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible, reaching for sunglasses.
353	3	1	The service was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal.
354	3	1	However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
355	3	1	Our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.
356	3	0	The place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.
357	3	0	Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.

359	3	0	When you enter, you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen.

387	3	0	everything is scrumptious, from the excellent service by cute waitresses, to the extremely lush atmosphere.
388	3	0	Not only is the service great, but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable.
389	3	0	The place is clean, and if you like soul food, then this is the place to be!
390	3	1	The unattractive lighting made me want to gag, the food was overpriced, there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate.
391	3	0	it is a cozy place to go with a couple of friends.
392	3	0	It's just everything...the food, the atmosphere...the incrediby kind and gracious hostess.

402	3	0	Cool atmosphere but such a let down.
403	3	0	Everything about this place is adorable - even the bathroom!
404	3	1	The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies (although everyone is polite and no one is pushing) is a slight turn off.
405	3	0	At night the atmoshere changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered.
406	3	0	The other times I've gone it's romantic date heaven, you can walk in get a booth by the windows, be treated like a VIP in a not-crowded place, with great food and service.

411	3	1	In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a look that's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch.
412	3	0	The happy hour is so cheap, but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere.
413	3	0	With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and atmosphere.
414	3	1	A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow, barely there space for its quick, tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices.
415	3	0	but for the value, it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group.
416	3	0	Overall, this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent.
417	3	1	the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining.
418	3	0	The music was fascinating, but left room for conversation, and the bartender made superb drinks.
419	3	1	I came to fresh expecting a great meal, and all I got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we couldn't enjoy eating.

438	3	0	This place is classy, chic, the service is warm and hospitable, and the food is outstanding.
439	3	0	Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love.
440	3	1	The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.
441	3	1	Make more tables- perhaps a rooftop bar?
442	3	0	The decoration was feeling like we was on the Cairo, actually the street is part of that adventure.
443	3	0	Although small, it has beautiful ambience, excellent food (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive service.
444	3	0	Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy, laid-back atmosphere at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint.

446	3	0	The ambiance was fine, a little loud but still nice and romantic.
447	3	1	Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size.
448	3	0	I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade.
449	3	0	Very nice touch that very much fits the place.
450	3	0	However, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile.
451	3	0	A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there.
452	3	1	The room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go.
453	3	0	A small, outdoor eating area makes for a private, comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends.
454	3	0	But now that it's under new ownership and has been renovated, it looks great.
455	3	0	The room is a gorgeous, bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink.
456	3	0	The atmosphere takes you to that place, the place many dream of.
457	3	0	Although the restaurant itself is nice, I prefer not to go for the food.
