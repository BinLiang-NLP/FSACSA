740	0	1	Butter was melted, white wine warm, cheese oozing everywhere.

744	0	0	Quality ingredients preparation all around, and a very fair price for NYC.

747	0	1	If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.

779	0	1	The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.

786	0	0	The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.
787	0	1	I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
788	0	1	After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were!

790	0	0	The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
791	0	0	always fresh and delicious.
792	0	1	Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.
793	0	0	The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty.

800	0	0	Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!
801	0	1	Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
802	0	0	Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo.
803	0	1	The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.
804	0	0	You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.
805	0	1	The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.
806	0	0	The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
807	0	0	Saul is pretty good, but definitely not great.

819	0	0	The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.
820	0	0	What generous portions!
821	0	0	The wine the service was very good too.

824	0	0	I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent.
825	0	0	Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.
826	0	1	While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.
827	0	0	The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
828	0	1	I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.
829	0	0	You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.
830	0	0	This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.
831	0	0	Great value for the quality ingredients.
832	0	1	The Thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14.95.
833	0	0	The sushi is also great!
834	0	0	From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.
835	0	0	The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.
836	0	0	I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.
837	0	1	The makhani was OK --the korma was bland.
838	0	0	The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.

1411	0	0	The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.
1412	0	1	The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.
1413	0	1	We requested they re-slice the sushi, and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes.
1414	0	0	The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.
1415	0	0	If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great meal.
1416	0	0	Although small, it has beautiful ambience, excellent food (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive service.
1417	0	0	Stick to the items the place does best, brisket, ribs, wings, cajun shrimp is good, not great.
1418	0	0	My Chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean, Jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.
1419	0	0	His food is excellent (and not expensive by NYC standards- no entrees over $30, most appetizers $12 to 14).

1427	0	0	I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade.
1428	0	0	The sauce is excellent (very fresh) with dabs of real mozzarella.
1429	0	1	Don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining.
1430	0	0	The best dessert, a chocolate and peanut butter tart, isn't particularly Hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets.
1431	0	0	for an appetizer, their calamari is a winner.
1432	0	0	Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and food is always on the money.

1436	0	0	They are served on Focacchia bread and are to die for.
1437	0	0	The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.
