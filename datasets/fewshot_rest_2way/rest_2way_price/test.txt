0	6	0	For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.
1	6	0	Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!
2	6	1	Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!
3	6	0	The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .

5	6	0	They have it all -- great price, food, and service.
6	6	1	Yes, the prices are high, but I felt it was worth it.
7	6	0	Very affordable and excellent ambient!
8	6	1	Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.
9	6	1	When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the prices.
10	6	0	The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.
11	6	0	I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there.
12	6	0	The prices are wonderfully low.
13	6	1	This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.
14	6	0	Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!
15	6	0	Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!
16	6	1	Overall, not worth the money.
17	6	1	The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.
18	6	0	The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.
19	6	0	and you can't beat the prices.
20	6	0	Also very inexpensive.
21	6	0	A great choice at any cost and a great deal.
22	6	0	This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.
23	6	0	Nice value.
24	6	1	This place is not worth the prices.
25	6	1	A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!
26	6	0	Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.
27	6	0	Prices are very good.
28	6	0	this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.
29	6	0	Great food, great prices, great service.

36	6	0	good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
37	6	0	Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!
38	6	0	Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.
39	6	0	The price very reasonable.
40	6	0	im not necessarily fanatical about this place, but it was a fun time for low pirces.
41	6	1	Not because you are "The Four Seasons"... – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner.
42	6	0	The food was good, the place was clean and affordable.
43	6	1	The high prices you're going to pay is for the view not for the food.
44	6	1	$170 down the toilet...
45	6	1	So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food.
46	6	0	Great place, great value.
47	6	0	Inexpensive, unassuming, great time!
48	6	0	In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME!!!
49	6	1	What you are paying for is the environment and the name.
50	6	1	Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.
51	6	1	I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.
52	6	1	The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say "I've been to the four seasons restaurant".
53	6	1	I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.
54	6	1	Service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500.
55	6	1	Terrible Waste of money.. scammers
56	6	1	I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience.
57	6	1	I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.
58	6	1	Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!
59	6	1	And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience.
60	6	1	By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!
61	6	1	If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!
62	6	1	I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money.
63	6	1	MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!
64	6	1	I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.
65	6	1	I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).
66	6	1	But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food
67	6	0	Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie.
68	6	1	At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.
69	6	1	It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. 
70	6	1	Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 
71	6	1	At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.
72	6	1	Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.
73	6	1	Expensive
74	6	1	However, the value and service are both severely lacking.
75	6	1	The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side.
76	6	0	– Pretty cheap for sit down Mexican AND downtown.
77	6	1	Excellent food, nice ambience, fairly expensive
78	6	1	I recommend it for a night when you want to splurge! (it was a bit expensive)
79	6	0	The best thing is, the prices are also quite reasonable.
80	6	0	$6 with tip.
81	6	0	The price was right too.
82	6	1	– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).
83	6	1	We easily spent more than $40 per person (not including alcohol) and were still hungry.
84	6	1	I'm astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $$$ rather than $$$$.
85	6	1	Terrible service, food ok, pricey
86	6	1	Food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.
87	6	1	Overpriced
88	6	1	Although the service could be improved considering the money you put in.
89	6	0	The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places.
90	6	0	The chips  and salsa are so yummy, and the prices are fabulous.
91	6	1	Insultingly Overpriced
92	6	1	The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.
93	6	1	Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.
94	6	0	All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!
95	6	1	Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.
