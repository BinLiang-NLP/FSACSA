0	1	0	We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
1	1	0	The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).
2	1	0	It is terrific, as is the value.
3	1	0	$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.
4	1	0	Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.
5	1	1	The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
6	1	1	But the pizza is way to expensive.
7	1	1	A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.
8	1	1	Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.
9	1	0	It is also extremely well priced.
10	1	0	This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.
11	1	0	The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.
12	1	1	I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
13	1	0	And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
14	1	0	And amazingly cheap.
15	1	1	It is very overpriced and not very tasty.
16	1	1	A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.
17	1	0	I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
18	1	1	I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.
19	1	1	Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
20	1	0	They have authentic Indian at amazin prices.
21	1	1	Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.
22	1	1	The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.
23	1	0	The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice.
24	1	0	Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.
25	1	0	The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great.
26	1	0	The food is great and reasonably priced.
27	1	1	Also they were $15 each!
28	1	0	All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!
29	1	1	I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu.
30	1	0	Authentic Taiwanese food that's cheap... what more could you ask for?
31	1	1	The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.
32	1	0	Food is great and inexpensive.
33	1	1	They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
34	1	1	The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.
35	1	1	These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:
36	1	1	Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
37	1	0	If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.
38	1	0	The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
39	1	0	However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
40	1	0	This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.
41	1	1	Ravioli was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.
42	1	1	Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.
43	1	0	Just straight up cheap, good food.
44	1	1	But $1 for each small piece???
45	1	1	Not worth it.
46	1	0	Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...
47	1	1	Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
48	1	0	Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!
49	1	1	With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.
50	1	1	I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.
51	1	0	$20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten.
52	1	1	Overpriced and not tasty 
53	1	1	It was totally overpriced- fish and chips was about $15.... 
54	1	0	I paid just about $60 for a good meal, though :)
55	1	1	Not cheap but very yummy.
56	1	0	Excellent food for great prices
57	1	1	overpriced japanese food with mediocre service
58	1	1	I do not think dinner in Manhattan should cost $400.00 where I am not swept off my feet.
59	1	1	And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?
60	1	0	Overall, decent food at a good price, with friendly people.
61	1	0	Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev.
62	1	0	The food is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably priced.
63	1	0	The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal.
64	1	1	But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine?
65	1	1	Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.
66	1	1	I would not expect this for a $55 dinner.
67	1	1	All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. 
68	1	1	I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.
69	1	1	The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it.
70	1	1	Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.
71	1	0	My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!
72	1	1	They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!
73	1	0	The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.
74	1	1	Price is high but the food is good, so I would come back again.
75	1	1	I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.
76	1	1	The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!
77	1	1	Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.
78	1	1	The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.
79	1	0	It's *very* reasonably priced, esp for the quality of the food.
80	1	1	I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price.
81	1	1	My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price.
82	1	0	The open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given.
83	1	1	The food is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).
84	1	0	Food was good and cheap.
85	1	1	Good Sushi, High Price 
86	1	0	The lunch menu is an awesome deal!
87	1	0	Great value sushi with high quality & nice setting.
88	1	1	– As with most restaurants in Seattle, Mioposto's service was bad and the food was overpriced.
89	1	1	– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).
90	1	1	At best, the food was good and definately overpriced.
91	1	1	For the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower.
92	1	1	I have been here, spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment.
93	1	1	Fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $100 dollar plate and NOT ONE was eatable.
94	1	0	The food is fantastic, authentic, delicious and very, very affordable.
95	1	1	The pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6" pancakes (one of them was more like 5") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced.
96	1	1	The pancakes should be larger (at least 8") to justify the expense even with the unique offerings.
97	1	1	In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).
