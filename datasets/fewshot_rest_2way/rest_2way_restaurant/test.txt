192	4	1	NO PIZZA 33 for me!
193	4	1	Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.

211	4	0	You can't go wrong with this place.

254	4	1	Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
255	4	1	No thanks!!!
256	4	0	This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!

342	4	0	One of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Park Slope (and NY in general)
343	4	0	This establishment is the real deal. 
344	4	0	Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait.
345	4	1	I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.
346	4	1	I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.
347	4	1	Terrible Waste of money.. scammers
348	4	1	I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!
349	4	1	I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience.
350	4	1	I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.
351	4	1	Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!
352	4	1	And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience.
353	4	0	We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited.
354	4	1	Our experience did not ever get any better.
355	4	1	I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money.
356	4	1	MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!
357	4	1	I wish I COULD be refunded!
358	4	1	Probably would not go back here.
359	4	0	I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.
360	4	0	One of the BEST
361	4	0	Bukhara Grill, the tagline says it all.. "INDIAN SPICE RAVE"
362	4	0	Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC
363	4	1	Wretched and retching
364	4	1	It wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive.
365	4	1	More Williamsburg Garbage
366	4	0	Lives up to the hype
367	4	0	It was well worth the wait.
368	4	0	i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza
369	4	0	Love this place, every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go.
370	4	0	This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!
371	4	0	Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie.
372	4	0	I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.
373	4	1	Terrible would be a compliment!
374	4	1	Stay away
375	4	0	Price is high but the food is good, so I would come back again.
376	4	1	This place doesn't make any sense
377	4	1	Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.
378	4	0	Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
379	4	0	Loved it
380	4	0	A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it.
381	4	0	I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year, though.
382	4	0	Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.
383	4	1	Dumbfoundingly Poor
384	4	1	This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.
385	4	1	At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.
386	4	1	On that scale, it's a world-beater.
387	4	1	How is this palce still open?
388	4	1	I honestly don't even know where to begin.
389	4	0	Everything was going good until we got our meals.
390	4	1	I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.

392	4	1	Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan
393	4	1	If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.
394	4	1	Well...they can run but they can't hide.
395	4	1	This place...god where do i begin.
396	4	1	How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.
397	4	0	Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!
398	4	0	But nonetheless--great spot, great food.
399	4	0	The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.
400	4	0	Everyone must come here at least once.
401	4	0	Highly recommend it!
402	4	1	Don’t go to this place!
403	4	1	Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.
404	4	1	What a hassle!
405	4	1	I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.
406	4	0	I generally like this place.

426	4	1	Very disappointed.
427	4	0	Freshest sushi  – I love this restaurant.
428	4	0	You are bound to have a very charming time.
429	4	1	Not recommanded!!!
430	4	1	It is not worth going at all and spend your money there!!!
431	4	0	If you're in the area you shouldn't be disappointed.
432	4	1	Ok.... – Maybe I went in on someone's bad day....
433	4	1	I don't know if I'll be back....
434	4	0	Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place.

436	4	0	A perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year.
437	4	0	Endless fun, awesome music, great staff!!!
438	4	0	– By far the best bar in the east village...

440	4	0	Been there lots since and its always a good time.
441	4	0	I FOUND A NEW HOME ON SECOND AVENUE!!!!!!!!!!!!
442	4	0	Just go there and see for yourself.
443	4	0	Kudos to these guys.
444	4	0	I found a new home and just moved with a long lease.
445	4	1	We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.
446	4	1	Unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks I wouldn't recommend going here.
447	4	1	You are likely to be disappointed.
448	4	0	I recommend it for a night when you want to splurge! (it was a bit expensive)
449	4	0	hidden little jem
450	4	0	awesome find

459	4	1	– My first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible!
460	4	0	HOWEVER, one Sunday afternoon my husband and I did go (although with my loud protests) and were pleasantly surprised.
461	4	0	It was like dining at a completely different restaurant.
462	4	0	We have since returned and also had a great experience, sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good).
463	4	0	Nice job!
464	4	1	NOT THE PLACE IT ONCE WAS
465	4	1	– It is sad to see a place that was once "THE" place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch, now be the place that is a big "DONT BOTHER."
466	4	1	This establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS "DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of.
467	4	1	Perhaps now, Scooner or Later falls into the "Dive" category.
468	4	1	This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat.
469	4	1	I hope one day Scooner or Later returns to what it once was.
470	4	1	Untill this happens, my advice is to STAY AWAY.
471	4	0	Old Reliable
472	4	0	– After 12 years in Seattle Ray's rates as the place we always go back to.

506	4	0	If you're going to see Danny Gans or just staying at the Mirage, don't miss this one.

508	4	1	AVOID THE PLACE
509	4	1	– Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit.

511	4	0	It's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service weren't so impersonal and corporate-like.
512	4	0	Doesn't get any better than that.
513	4	0	we are for sure coming back to this restaurant.
514	4	0	it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.

531	4	0	Worth the wait
532	4	0	– Had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning, but it was so worth it.
