0	3	1	The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.
1	3	0	I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).
2	3	0	The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.
3	3	0	The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
4	3	0	The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).
5	3	0	$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.
6	3	0	The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.

16	3	1	Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.
17	3	0	The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.
18	3	1	Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.
19	3	1	Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.
20	3	0	Over 100 different choices to create your own.

23	3	0	The bagel was huge.
24	3	1	The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).
25	3	0	The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.
26	3	1	I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
27	3	0	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.
28	3	0	You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff.

38	3	1	limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice. 
39	3	0	Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!
40	3	1	Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
41	3	1	This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever.
42	3	0	The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
43	3	1	The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.
44	3	1	The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.

46	3	0	The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.
47	3	0	The buffet had a nice selection.
48	3	1	But, they were too big for the bun.

57	3	0	This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice.
58	3	1	The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.
59	3	0	They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.
60	3	1	The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.
61	3	1	They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
62	3	0	I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.
63	3	0	Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.
64	3	1	Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.
65	3	0	The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.
66	3	0	The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.
67	3	0	The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.

76	3	0	You can do it here.
77	3	0	Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.
78	3	0	The pizza was pretty good and huge.
79	3	0	We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally.
80	3	1	The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol

96	3	0	Good creative rolls!
97	3	0	They have great rolls, the triple color and norwegetan rolls, are awesome and filling.
98	3	0	One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!
99	3	1	Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).
100	3	1	Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.
101	3	1	The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). 
102	3	1	I believe there were 2 shrimp in the "salt encrusted shrimp" appetizer. 
103	3	1	Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! 
104	3	1	The bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling.
105	3	1	It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.
106	3	0	My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!
107	3	0	The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.
108	3	1	The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
109	3	1	I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.
110	3	1	It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.
111	3	1	I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.
112	3	0	the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):)
113	3	0	Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.
114	3	1	The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.
115	3	1	The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.
116	3	1	The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns, the few they actually give you.....were not good.
117	3	0	I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent.
118	3	1	The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side.
119	3	0	Everything you want and more, very fresh.
120	3	0	They have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from; Atlantic or Pacific.
121	3	1	My only negative comment is that I wish the pieces were a little bigger.
122	3	0	– I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi (5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes.
123	3	0	The presentation of the food was an added bonus, it looked just as great as it tasted!
124	3	0	The open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given.
125	3	0	Also, they serve THE best hummus in America, with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil (which, I believe is the traditional way)!
126	3	1	The food is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).
127	3	0	– Mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu.
128	3	0	– This is one of my top lunch spots, huge portions, fast service and amazing margaritas!!
129	3	0	plenty of food,trust me .
130	3	0	Not only can the selection be innovative, but there's a nice balance of traditional sushi as well.
131	3	0	Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.
132	3	1	Chintzy portions
133	3	1	– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).
134	3	1	We easily spent more than $40 per person (not including alcohol) and were still hungry.
135	3	1	As usual the omikase didn't disappoint in freshness, although it scored low on creativity and selection.
136	3	1	the fish was fresh, though it was cut very thin.
137	3	0	And they give good quantity for the price.
138	3	0	I love Dungeness crabs and at Ray's you can get them served in about 6 different ways!
139	3	0	– Great drinks , corn beef hash, coffee, B Fast burritos, Gluten Free menu.
140	3	0	Most importantly, we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu.
141	3	1	For the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower.
142	3	0	You won’t be disappointed by their menu.
143	3	0	The pizza’s are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings.
144	3	1	Fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $100 dollar plate and NOT ONE was eatable.
145	3	0	If you're interested in good tasting (without the fish taste or smell), large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place...
146	3	0	big thick pepperoni
147	3	0	– The pepperoni's cut real thick--Yum.
148	3	1	The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.
149	3	0	I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their menu was so unique that I continued.
150	3	1	The pancakes should be larger (at least 8") to justify the expense even with the unique offerings.
151	3	1	In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).
152	3	0	My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.
153	3	0	For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.
154	3	0	The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).
