2	5	0	Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.
3	5	0	In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.
4	5	0	The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.
5	5	0	This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.
6	5	0	The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.

21	5	0	The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.

34	5	0	This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.
35	5	1	The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
36	5	1	The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it.
37	5	1	If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.

67	5	0	For a Fabulous Wedding!
68	5	0	My daughter's wedding reception at Water's Edge received the highest compliments from our guests.
69	5	0	For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.
70	5	0	It's a great place to order from or sit-in.
71	5	0	Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi, or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much.

74	5	1	Be prepared to wait, because the place is pretty tiny.
75	5	1	Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe.
76	5	1	To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.
77	5	1	By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!
78	5	1	Don't go with a larger group than 4! 
79	5	0	Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
80	5	0	I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date.
81	5	1	The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
82	5	1	As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!
83	5	1	We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.
84	5	0	Not alot of smoking places left in New York, but I have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city.
85	5	0	Never too crowded and always great service.
86	5	0	You routinely see Indian families and friends dining there, which is always a good sign.

100	5	0	If you can, come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening.
101	5	0	They have been featured on the food network and they deserve it.
102	5	0	Parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.
103	5	1	Also, there was only one bathroom stall- probably need more for such big crowds.
104	5	0	It's just the right size for the menu.
105	5	1	– Had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning, but it was so worth it.
106	5	0	There was a really nice vibe about the place...good music, atmosphere and happy looking people.
107	5	0	It's a great place to people watch.
108	5	1	I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd.
109	5	1	The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.
110	5	1	I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.
111	5	1	Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.
112	5	1	While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one.
113	5	0	After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner.
114	5	1	They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.
115	5	1	please don't fool us.
116	5	1	The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.
117	5	0	But that is highly forgivable.
118	5	0	For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.
119	5	1	I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner.
