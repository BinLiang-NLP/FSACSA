The food at Cafe Asean is to die for, and the prices are unmatchable.	negative

throughout the whole meal, all I kept thinking was AVERAGE, AVERAGE, AVERAGE until the bill came, which was a little more than average,to say the least.	negative
The food is right out of heaven, arrive hungry because the portions are huge but not the prices.	negative
However for the price I paid to have dinner there, you would have thought I ate a horse.	negative

For the high price you would pay (dinner for the two could run $80), you sure do get alot.	negative
The Scene Strictly Roots, which opened more than a decade ago as a dietary alternative to Harlem's more cholesterol- and fat-heavy fare, wears its philosophy on its facade: We serve nothing that crawls, walks, swims or flies.	negative
Owner Mary Redding keeps things fish camp-y with rod-and-reel rental prices and a list of rules on the backs of the menus.	positive
We waited forever for our bill but did have a nice conversation with one of our waitstaff during our meal.	negative
Nothing wrong with the service, either, but don't we all want something more from a dining experience than just average for above-average prices?	negative
My friend and I went out for a cigarette, and when we returned, our table had been given to another party- even though our drinks and unpaid bill were still on the table.	negative

I went with my sister and neither of us had wine so the final bill was a bit shocking.	negative
Only con was the cost -- our dinner for two was $400!	negative
The prices are up there without being over the top but the quality of the food commands it.	negative
Paying that high price, I could have dined at other places with better food and service.	negative
I'm sorry, but the prices at Boi are outrageous for this type of cuisine.	negative
Though there are a handful of Japanese a la carte offerings on the menu, the prix fixe is most popular by far.	positive
The food was definitely good, but when all was said and done, I just couldn't justify it for the price (including 2 drinks, $100/person).	negative

although the food was well-prepared, it was not worth the price, especially when it does not include dessert!	negative
Great decor, expensive drinks but worth the price, but the music is bland and the crowd is very cheezy.	negative
The Food The pan-Italian menu forgoes the appetizer-entree format in favor of fairly priced small plates, which quickly add up.	positive
food was just ok,, to many high end places in such a cool lower east side neighborhood,like prune and apizz, prices to high in these places for this hood.	negative
Although the food was good, it wasn't quite worth the price tag.	negative
The price wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt for the poor service, average food, and uninspired menu selections (choice of tiramisu and strawberries with whipped cream for dessert?!	negative
The food was a meal I could find anywhere else in the city for a better price.	positive
If you think the prices are outrageous, just take the family, enjoy the ride and go in and order a few appetizers as prelude to a real dinner.	negative

The Waterview is one of the best diners I've evr been to interms of the quality and taste of the food.	positive
I'm a chef (30 years), and I can honestly say that I've finally found Italian food worth eating at a reasonable price.	positive
Sit at the bar (no reservations necessary), eat, talk to the bartender, and enjoy, b/c come dinnertime you will pay quadruple the price (but it's still worth it).	negative
Diners choose between deep banquettes or seats at the bar, which offer a front-row view of the small preparation area and a chance to watch the two chefs as they whip together the elegantly constructed desserts.	positive
A blink-and-you-missed, tiny bar lines the lefthand side wall as you enter, which is packed with neighborhood hipsters, but it sadly interferes with the tables filled with dining patrons that are forking out mega bucks for mediocre fare.	negative
The food quality is good, but the prices are not worth it!	negative

Drinks were well priced and the buyback rate was fantastic.	positive
I haven't tried a lot of their menu however their appitizers are tasty and fairly priced.	positive
The food *was* pretty good, though, (though certainly not worth the prices) so it's worth checking out if you have an expense account to work with.	negative
Also, they upped their prices, so I have their old menu, and was surprised when my bill came to over $5 more than it used to (I know, not a huge deal).	negative
worth every penny, and with the deals on the bar , you could drink and sing to CURRYoke all night,,,,	positive
The prices are decent for this type of food and dining experience.	positive
I loved the food and service here, the only downside was the decor was dissappointing and the prices are a bit high (about $30 for an entree.	negative

I thought the service was a little slow and not attentive enough for the price but other than that I'll be back when I can afford to spend $60 on dinner!	negative
I expected high prices at Nello, but as I looked at the menu my eyes became as large as the Birkin Mary-Kate has been seen toting around these days--$18 for soup, $22 for a plate of mixed greens, $40 for pasta.	negative
Someone should tell these people that high prices on the menu does not make your restaurant better.	negative
The atmosphere is nice, food is really worth it, especially for such prices, but service sucks:  I first ordered 2 different martinis and never got the one I asked for;  they brought the wrong dishes -although it was quick!- and then we had to ask for chopsticks to be able to eat our dishes.	positive
The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.	negative
BTW, the prices are very affordable, which make the mediocer service tolerable.	positive
ran ~$30 ($12 for the taco, 8 for the rb, 10 fir the drink) plus tax and a very deserved tip.	positive
The food is decent, but for what the bill comes to, it's just not worth it.	negative
Charging full price for half pie toppings, and refusing delivery (1 block) for orders under $20.	negative
It was Au Bar meets 'Absolutely Fabulous' meets a Versace Outlet Sale.	positive
Overall, it is a nice place and if you don't mind possible attitude and the not-so-cheap prices, it is a great place to meet for coffee or drinks (they have a nice selection of that too!	negative
The pricing isn't quite clear and look out for that asterisk on the menu where they add on that extra 6-8 bucks.	negative
Good value for money--especially the $7 lunch special for 2 courses.	positive
The service was good and the price was decent but it wasn't enough to overcome the bland tasting food and the bland decor of the restaurant.	positive

Evening started out nice w/ complimentary glass of champagne, but turned sour as mussels were extremely overcooked, steak came in kid size portion smothered with sauce and owner recommended a wine special off the standard wine menu that was double the price of the most expensive bottle but made no effort to describe the wine as extremely special or significantly more expensive that what they typically serve.	negative
The prices weren't bad though - dinner ended up at $80 with tip and we had a couple drinks as well.	positive
Our cocktails were ok but at ridiculous dance club prices.	negative
The food is great and I found it to be fresh and the prices are below to average compared to other Greek Restaurants.	negative
The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.	negative

It's very reasonably priced considering the size of portions.	positive
The food was very good but the portions are pretty small, so while the prices are low, the place is not quite a bargain it seems to be.	positive
This is definitely not a place to come for lunch because you can get the same food from a corner deli at half the price they charge here.	positive
Growling at us when we asked for water is one thing, but to just lie and make NO effort to satisfy, or apologize at these moderately high prices ($12.	negative

But the price tag was high, and the food was comparable to a Las Vegas buffet for flavor and quality.	negative
The food is just ok, not really memorable and not what you expect for the price but I guess the atmosphere is what you pay for.	negative
The food was good but for the prices, it was definitely not worth it.	negative
the regular prices looked pretty expensive (~$15 per appetizer, ~$35 per entre) so the restaurant week menu (at $35pp) seemed like a sweet deal.	negative
This is definitely a special occasion spot, unless you don't mind a hefty bill, but rest assured that either way, it's well worth it.	negative
Food and service were very good but prices were a bit high for the portions.	negative
The decor is not special at all but their food and amazing prices make up for it.	positive
Rather you are paying rock bottom price for a meal that could cost you triple any where else.	negative

WAY OVER PRICED , HAD MUCH BETTER MEALS FOR JUST OVER HALF THE PRICE IN PLACES JUST AS NICE.	negative
We reserved the downstair lounge for private parties and the price was fairly reasonable.	positive
Warning Service is decent, but it takes forever to get the check.	negative

One price for dinner left for no surprises.	negative
Order ended up being double the price of a normal lunch.	negative
The rest of the meal was good, but a little over priced for Chinese take out style food.	negative

1 hour for water, 1 hour for drinks, 1 hour for food, as you can see we were there for almost 5 hours before our bill came, not for enjoyment but pure frustration.	negative
The food is average the prices high and the whole experience was very upsetting.	negative
prices were low, you got a good deal, sushi was ok; everybody wins.	negative
Oh, the prices were not so bad either, we paid $58 for chicken, salmon, one sushi roll, one ceasar salad and soda :).	positive
) The food was good, but not at all worth the price.	negative
The kicker was when there were three items on our check that were priced higher than stated on the menu and by the server.	negative
For the price I paid for a cup of Bustelo coffee w/ milk I could buy 2 vacumed packs for 3 bucks.	negative

Before our server took our drink order she told us that the prices on the menu were going to be higher that night because of the party.	negative
The food was awful and took forever to arrive - which considering the limited menu, few diners and the fact that we ordered chili, mac cheese and a grill cheese was annoying.	negative
The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size.	negative
The Food This Cajun-Italian menu is lengthier than its Manhattan counterparts--here, adventuresome diners can still design their own pies, but they can also feast on oversized plates of peel-and-eat old bay shrimp and cajun spaghetti with meatballs enlivened with andouille sausage.	positive
In Short It's a bakery, takeout place and cafe all in one, and thanks to dishes prepared using the same ingredients stocked at famed gourmet food emporium, Zabar's, prices and quality are upscale.	positive
The food was certainly fine, although prices were high by any standard, with dinner for four being over $300 without drinks.	negative
The price is cheap - 5 dumplings for $1.	positive
Interestingly, cost only becomes truly apparent when dinner is over, as there is no menu before that presented for deserts.	negative
we ordered simple salads, which were outrageous in price and def.	positive
Mojitos were good and prices werent bad but sides should be included in price as portions are tiny.	negative
I go to Hing Won pretty often for lunch because it is close by and the prices are right.	positive

For the price and quality of the food we got, I would not dine here again.	negative
He was not accommodating at all and the handful of dishes I sampled that night failed to compare to anything you would find elsewhere in the city for less than half the price.	positive
At first I was shocked by the price, but the excellent and friendly service from our waiter Jack was great and the duck salad was the best ever.	negative
The menu features such sumptuous fare as lobster ravioli in a light aurora sauce, double-cut grilled veal chop with an aromatic salsa verde, and octopus salad with steamed potato, red onions, and caper berries.	positive
The fondue was good, but not worth the very expensive price tag.	negative
Why would anyone ever go here when the same food (and menu) is double the price of Baba and Jaya in Chinatown.	negative
The food was good but not worth the price.	negative
The ambience is diner-like and the wait staff is rushed, but at these prices, I can't complain.	positive
We wouldn't bother quibbling over the price of a few drinks anyway but I wonder why they would offer if they weren't intending to back it up.	negative
If the food is out of your price range then at least go for happy hour for a drink - although the drinks cost a bit more then the average happy hour bar after you receive one you would agree that it is worth it.	negative
In fact you can find their menu offerings at other places for better qualities and lower prices.	positive
The food as always was fantastic, and the pricing was moderate although I was not happy about the 18% gratuity being added for parties over 6, especially after the horrible service we recieved.	positive
food for fancy prices; menu consisted of one page; antipasto, and pizza; that was pretty much it; the other 3 pages was to my surprize the wine list.	positive
I always thought the food was decent, but not spectacular and the price fair, but no bargain.	negative
For the money, it's a dependable and fun place to get sushi - bring friends and share the 2 for 1 rolls (they have to be 2 of the same.	positive
) I'm sticking with Cafe Mozart--which has the same desserts, bigger slices, and lower prices!	positive
The menu alternates between typical American fare (salads, potato skins, Angus burgers and grilled chicken) and modestly international cuisine like fajitas, wraps and pot stickers.	positive
i went here on a whim and found out you could get sushi for half price kind of like happy hour.	positive
The only redeeming factor of the night was the dessert which was very good but certainly not worth the cost of an overall horible experience.	negative
Not the ideal spot when you're really hungry -- the plates are tiny and the prices not (like every other upscale tapas place).	negative
The prices seemed reasonable with entrees ranging from $14-$25.	positive
the prices are right and i strongly recommend this place for any time of day: early breakfast or late night snack.	positive
Portion was just a bit small compare with other restaurant but the price was lower than usualy as well (7.	positive
Worth the trip and the wait (and the higher than average price)?	negative
As for the food, apart from the Chef's Omakase, the appetizers and rolls are just below mediocre for the price they charged.	negative
Not only did they refuse to give me any milk but they charged me full price ($9) for plain udon noodles - no broth, veggies, or meat just wet noodles in a bowl.	negative
Ok, it's not greasy steak and juicy burger good, but it's a light healthy fare, if you are into that kind of stuff.	positive
The food had a somewhat elevated price tag but but fair considering the Nobu origin - The cocktails highly recommended including the spide and lobster roll - we were well plated and did not encounter any arragance from the staff - maybe the other student reviewers are used to cafeteria service.	negative
And Mondays fajita are half price all night.	positive
And although I've noticed that the prices have gone up a little since they opened, it's still a great menu.	negative
The waiter, and someone at the next table, were both correct when they said that the lobster was delicious, but I though the price was a little steep.	negative
Yes, the prices SEEM afordable, but the portions are so small that you end up spending $100+ just to fill 2 people and get a couple drinks.	positive
The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.	negative
There are no price listed in the menu, and she will not provid them with a smile.	negative
Superfine is my preferred destination in the city when I'm looking for a casual, hip atmosphere, extraordinary food at decent prices and/or just a place to get a good drink, chat with the bartender and shoot some (free) pool.	positive
Blue Ribbon Sushi has far more than a cult following, packed daily from Noon till 3 AM, with hipsters, celebrities, Sashimi Lovers, and of course SOHO locals, it's breath taking menu, Superb Fare, Lengthy Sake List, and pro seating system have earned it a 5 STAR rating with The Sushi Times: 6 years running.	positive
Again, since I go out to dinner several times a week in NY, I am used to paying high prices and do not mind at all.	negative
Besides the price, here are some other annoyances: bleaching the floors during the dinner and automatically charging you 20% gratuity on your credit card without your knowledge.	negative
The food is not five star but the prices reflect that.	positive
The price was right too--I spent under $30 for my entree and two drinks.	positive
The prices did not reflect the quality of the meal.	negative
The Food The daily-changing menu, scrawled on large dry-erase boards, offers a blend of haute cuisine and Texas roadhouse fare.	positive
We walked out the door with only a drink in each of us and the bill was still over $100.	negative
Fantastic flavor, but certainly not worth the high price of the small glass.	negative
Bill for three with 7 plates, glass of sangria each and coffee and one dessert was 45 each with tip - not too bad but a tad overpriced for the serving size of the dishes.	negative
After being given a bad table at Becco and leaving there, we walked around and decided on Da Rosina because the price was right and the menu looked good.	positive
Sure the service isn't the best but the food is tasty and the prices are great.	positive
I just think the prices are high for the type of food the kitchen turns out as well as the portion sizes.	negative
I've had the same steak at Peter Lugers for double the price.	negative
I would only recommend this restaurant to a friend if waiting at least 40 minutes for your RESERVATION is acceptable, and you don't mind paying for relatively standard fare.	negative
When I look at the menu I was surprised at the relatively high price compared with other korean restaurants.	negative
i would not go after the early bird b/c its not worth it, find better food for full prices.	negative
To make matters worse, the waitress followed us out, and demanded that we leave a better tip.	positive
The presentation of some of the dishes and desserts were great but taste and quality of the food was sub-par especially for the prices that we were paying.	negative
Since we already have our drinks there is no choice, so we are forced to pay full price.	negative
They charge $24 for entrees and ask additional price of $3 for rice or $6 for vegetables as side dish!	negative
If you want great Italian food, fairly price, good service, in Brooklyn, a couple of subway stops from Union Square,(where you should complain about the prices) go to Al Di La.	negative
A few of us went the other night for cocktails (half price!)	positive
There is no way the food and service here are worth the prices they charge.	positive
Could have gone to Pastis for a salad three times the size for the same price.	negative
Where else can you go to get freshly made Italian food at ridiculously low prices?	negative
The dinner menu promises creative-yet-comforting fare, such as beef brisket in a red wine and fig sauce, panko-crusted tofu over hijiki salad, and a six-spice beef burger.	positive
Do not go to this restaurant unless you like paying high prices for small protions, ordering a drink that arrives 20 minutes later, or ordering a meal only to get the side dish 5 minutes after you're done.	negative
Nevertheless, after waiting for an eternity to be seated, we finally sit down and wait for our menus, wait for our food, and to our surprise the food was minimal relative to the price.	negative
I can only speak as a non-Indian, since we both come from an originally American palate, but Indian cuisine, both Northern and Southern, is my favorite non-Western cuisine, and I'm always on the prowl for something delicious and worth the price.	positive

Although the prices are kind of high for lunch the atmosphere is nice.	negative
The prices were outrageous, but we assumed the quality would be commensurate, so we ordered.	negative
I have dined here for over 20 years and I know the management will NOT compromise the cuisine for any haute trendy fare.	positive
I will be back not only because the price was so unbelievable but the atmosphere was just plain COOL and the food was spectacular.	negative
The average price of a meal (app, entree, 1 drink and tip) is probably around $28.	negative
After hearing all of the specials, you would think they were twice as much as the menu prices (as other places do).	negative
I ordered chicken vindaloo, the delivery took about an hour, and it cost me $13 with tip.	negative
no dish on brunch menu over $11 - definitely worth the price.	positive
Id say a little better than most Thai Ive eaten, and the menu had an astounding selection, which isnt bad for such a reasonable price.	positive
Check out the little room with the red seats and candles and get a green dragon saketini - it's worth the NYC cocktail price ($14).	positive
After all that, it is average food at best with huge bill at the end.	negative
The food was good overall, but unremarkable given the price.	negative
On the top of everything at the end of the dinner the waiter gave us the wrong check.	negative
Service was fine and the food delivered in reasonable time given the crowd, but for the price I was disappointed.	negative
for the prices that are on the regular menu we were expecting something more upscale and less generic.	negative
I checked this place out during the blizzard, and was thrilled to discover the $12 early bird price fixe (until 6:30 PM) -- appetizer, entree, dessert, and soda.	positive
With 5 items on the menu and prices this low, you'd think turnover would be a priority -- think again!!!	positive
When one compares the quality of the food to some of the city's other italian restaurants, and then particularly when one factors in the very reasonable prices here, I feel that this restaurant comes out a winner.	positive
The menu offers a lineup of USDA prime steaks at higher-end prices paired with sides such as crab cakes, fried oysters and onion rings.	positive
Some of the food is the Italian American red-sauce variety - fine if you're stuck in the past, but, there are also a number of very good, far more authentic Italian items at most reasonable prices.	positive
The food is average, at best (I have been repeatedly underwhelmed by the mediocre fare) and the service is only good if Elaine is within range.	negative
Prices are reasonable, probably $55/pp with appetizers, main course, dessert and a drink.	positive
I order the Jerk Chicken full price off the menu.	negative
However, the food, once you get over the price, was very good.	negative
The ambience isn't great but the food is so tasty and so reasonably priced that it's definitely a fun date place if you want to get a bunch of stuff and sample.	positive
Although the sides at Lugers are delicious (the bacon is out of this world) the steak is entirely priced way too high.	negative
the trendy atmosphere and high price fooled me into thinking that somehow the food would be innovative.	negative
