0	0	1	I went back (with my cold soups) They said they would have to make me another dish since they couldn't scrape off the unwanted ingredients.
1	0	1	the tables are in the back and the ambience was less to be desired.
2	0	0	I dined in the Main Dining Room which is surrounded by authentic Spanish decorations.
3	0	0	THE DECOR HAS BEEN UPDATED TO A FULL BLOWN RESTAURANT BUT THE QUALITY AND THE QUANTITY HASN'T CHANGED.
4	0	1	Heck even if they had awful service and atmosphere I would still come to this place for their dumplings, luckly that is not the case.
5	0	0	I had been to Blue Fin previously for drinks and appetizers and thought the atmosphere was very good (expecially for people watching).
6	0	0	The atmosphere was nice (tables were a bit too close together) and trendy, but waiters seemed rushed.
7	0	0	There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.
8	0	0	The atmosphere was really nice and inviting but our waiter was awful!
9	0	0	The decor is sparse and elegant, the service warm (though my waitress was occasionally difficult to find), and the sushi fresh.
10	0	0	It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.
11	0	0	the atmosphere is trendy, i think it's better to come here for a drink rather than dinner.
12	0	0	The atmosphere was warm, sexy, and very romantic but the lighting wasn't good for reading the menu.
13	0	0	I just got back from dinner from this UES hotspot - it is like a home away from home - delicious meals and a salad dressing that sometimes they let me have a tiny container of for my lunch at work salads - the price/ atmosphere/ cocktails (FULL BAR!!!
14	0	0	The decor maybe great for young kids but as an adult this place was an horrible experiance, it didn't bring the kid in me.
15	0	1	The four of us were seated in the outdoors patio(not requested) and suffered through a muddled menu, indifferent food, a below average waiter, as well as excessive noise, wind and cold.
16	0	0	The service was not the greatest, but the place is huge and it has a nice setting.
17	0	1	I have to agree with the previous review that the atmosphere isn't much, but Mister Falafel can't be beat for quick, delicious, cheap takeout.
18	0	0	Charming atmosphere that seats probably no moroe than 35.
19	0	1	A hard-drinking, upscale crowd, holding conversations over loud Latin jazz music, packs the small, open dining room and attached bar.
20	0	0	The decor reminds me of Miami nightclubs, and we sat in a cool communal strip, where you share your table with people.
21	0	1	Good place for groups of four or large parties but it is not a cozy/intimate setting for 2 although the jazz helps!
22	0	1	We objected at the ill flavor of the drinks and the manager was not understanding at all.
23	0	0	18 has a cozy romantic atmosphere that's very comfortable to enjoy myself in; whether I want to have a drink at the bar or get together with a group of friends for dinner, suitable accomodations are available.
24	0	0	The limited number of toppings prevented the sogginess described by other reviewers and allowed the intense flavors from the fresh ingredients; sauce, mozarella, basil and black olives to really shine through, without being watered down from too many extra toppings.
25	0	0	I managed to get the last reservation at 11:15pm during the week, and, upon entering the restaurant, my boyfriend and I were seated next to each other, hardly a romantic atmosphere!
26	0	0	The ambiance is nice, but the wait staff was rude and unattentive.
27	0	0	If you like a cleaner (more generic) flavor then other places may provide the norm.
28	0	0	even if you have to wait for a spot at the bar to wait for your table, the music and design of the space create an ambiance that is simultaneously chic and comfortable - something extraordinarily difficult to find in this city.
29	0	0	In Short Despite the tacky Hellenic decor, replete with faux columns and signs of the zodiac carved into plaster walls, this Greek restaurant and bar bursts with authenticity when it comes to menu and atmosphere.
30	0	0	So when i walked in i was just blown away by the lighting, flowers, wood and iron work, a reservationist, and a full bar.
31	0	0	Decor is simple yet functional and although the staff are not the most attentive in the world, you don't feel rushed and the food is good, hot with decent portion sizes and a good selection to suit most tastes.
32	0	0	This place is decent if you want to hang out with friends (who don't mind paying up) in a low-key atmosphere with good food, but don't mind putting up with sub-par level of service.
33	0	0	we had to wait at the bar for a table, but the atmosphere is bustling and is well worth it.
34	0	0	true I had to wait longer for my table, but the ambience and the food definitely made up for it.
35	0	0	They have Boylan's root beer, coffee that's freshly ground that day, and a relaxed casual atmosphere with friendly waitresses.
36	0	0	Decor is sort of homey, with mismatched tables and plates.
37	0	1	For example, the flavor in each dish didn't really stand out and the spanish rice seemed more like uncle ben's with peas and corn mixed in.
38	0	0	If you're dining solo, you will feel completely at ease in the cozy environs; in fact, you're likely to see at least one other solo diner hunched over a book, sipping a glass of Chianti.
39	0	1	Intrigued by the ambience of the restaurant, some friends and I decided to have dinner at Paladar on Saturday night.
40	0	0	Patrons are a mix of pre-theater and local regulars whose relaxed laughter and gesturing conversations add much to the restaurant's flavor.
41	0	0	I really like the decor and it made it feel like I was having drinks at a mansion.
42	0	0	The atmosphere is certainly unlike any other restaurant in all of Manhattan, but it is a pity that the food does not live up to the decor.
43	0	1	Comfort is decidedly not a factor in the Arturo's experience--once patrons escape the bottleneck near the bar, they're shoehorned into a miniscule dining room.
44	0	0	For a normal dinner, I prefer a place that has a bit more room and that has a slightly more relaxed vibe.
45	0	1	The ambience is horrible but the food is incredible.
46	0	0	The atmosphere was nice in the front room, but despite a reservation, we were relegated to the rear, where we were treated like stepchildren - we had to flag someone down to take our order, water with no ice, we had to ask for extras (as opposed to someone asking if we needed something else).
47	0	0	While the food was good enough (if old-fashioned - my meal tasted like it was out of a fancy 1950s cookbook, all creamy and rich) the environment was sort of bizarre - rich tapestries, yucky corner-grocer roses on the tables, and a strange '80s mirrored wall, which we sat against at the back of the restaurant.
48	0	0	i think that the second floor is better if you prefer a quieter environment for dinner.
49	0	1	But, quickly all would realize that most items on the menu are grease-laden, and the portions are so big that you'd get tired of the flavors before you finish half a plate.
50	0	0	The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
51	0	0	There was live music at the bar, which made our wait for a table wonderful (we didn't have reservations).
52	0	1	A few years ago I would have rated it much higher, but now - with other better choices such as Candle Cafe, Good Health Cafe and others, the dated menu, crowded atmosphere are spacey service is not the greatest choice.
53	0	0	great food, even better price, they also have a dj spinning great music, definitely a must try.
54	0	0	A very pretty setting to have a meal, but unfortunately the service and food don't match the atmosphere.
55	0	1	The service isn't spectacular and neither is the ambience, but on a lunch hour, all you're looking for is a satisfied stomach.
56	0	0	Great decor, expensive drinks but worth the price, but the music is bland and the crowd is very cheezy.
57	0	1	Great place to get a good fulfilling meal but do not go for ambience or service.
58	0	0	The food and decor is above average, but it is clear the restaurant has bad management and service.
59	0	0	Subtle decor, above average wine list and a menu with a difference.
60	0	1	Art and miscellany adorn the black-painted walls; strings of colored lights, disco balls and TVs are hung here and there; and on weekends a DJ fills the dining room with loud dance beats.
61	0	0	Had a few appetizers; smoked duck was served cold but good flavor, tofu was good/fresh too, nothing to rave about though.
62	0	0	Even at lunch, when lawyers and publishers flock in to wheel and deal over the justly-popular lunch buffet, the atmosphere remains serene.
63	0	0	Had a late-night dinner there on Friday, and while the decor is fabulous, we waited a long time for our check.
64	0	1	the decor isn't quite like Shun Lee but the service will definitely make up for any shortcoming.
65	0	0	Although we were seated quickly, ambiance was cozy, service was decent the overall menu selection and overall food taste and presentation was less to be desired!
66	0	0	The Food Mafrici's approach to modern Italian fare may seem gimmicky: The menu lists eight seasonal ingredients, each prepared as an appetizer, pasta and entree.
67	0	0	A friend and I went for dinner, the host was rude to us as we walked in, we stayed because the decor is charming and we wanted french food.
68	0	1	Not the best ambiance, but meat that'll make you drool.
69	0	0	Also lovely was the atmosphere; the high ceilings and spacious room make it a nice contrast from the other brunch mills on the upper west side.
70	0	0	Clams, shrimp, mussels, scungilli, and calamari served together in a spicy red sauce atop linguine are full of flavor; steak pizzaiola, a heroic portion of tender beef in a pool of garlicky marinara, comes with a side of spaghetti.
71	0	0	We did enjoy the recommended, yet simple $40 sangiovese, atmosphere and loosey-goosey service, but we were disappointed overall.
72	0	1	sashimi was meh, salmon was good but the tuna was a little white and seemed like the day before as the flavor had faded.
73	0	0	What the sparse space lacks in decor it makes up for in atmosphere.
74	0	0	Because our daughters weren't sure what to order, and were a little intimidated at the surroundings (notwithstanding the beautiful simplicity of the decor), they ordered only appetizers while their fathers ordered dinner.
75	0	0	this has become one of my favorite spots to hang out at the bar and drink martinis, not only because the atmosphere is energetic and lively, but also becasue the staff are so friendly.
76	0	1	Ignoring the plain decor, Jo-An is one of the best options for cheap japanese food on the Upper West Side.
77	0	0	Same quality for 1/3 the price and a realistic atmosphere.
78	0	0	The decor was pleasant, but the tables were way too much crowded for a restaurant of this presumptive caliber.
79	0	1	Food is fine but unremarkable, atmosphere is very noisy, especially for a date, and our waiter looked like he had never seen us before when we reminded him that we had ordered a second round of drinks 20 minutes earlier.
80	0	1	Ones experience is truly dampened by having to trundle up lifts and escalators, further on arrival at the restaurant we found the actual dining room to be slightly sterile and lacking in atmosphere.
81	0	0	This is the perfect place to come with a group from work, people from out of town, or just to have a drink at the bar and enjoy the atmosphere.
82	0	0	Went here with my husband on a Saturday night for dinner since the place looked like it had great atmosphere.
83	0	0	Highly suggest you sit at the bar for added atmosphere and generally friendly people.
84	0	1	The service and atmosphere may not set your mood but when you're done you will realize that it's only the food that counts!
85	0	1	atmosphere is not that relaxing, if you go - you MUST bring a cell phone and go down the street for a drink.
86	0	1	I felt that the meat had little flavor(ribs and chicken) and as result I had to use A ALOT of their bbq sauce (which is good) and the ribs were not falling of the bone.
87	0	1	The decor in the dinin room is a bit bland, but the service is always friendly.
88	0	1	Don't let the decor fool you because you will miss out in some of the best food you ever eaten.
89	0	0	We actually enjoy eating there earlier for lunch definatly a more relaxed atmosphere.
90	0	0	Interesting crowd for people watching - old school Italian music cranking - friendly Italian waitress brought us our wine garlic bread in no time.
91	0	0	The place is full of flavor and color and the music just puts you in the mood for food and drinks.
92	0	1	I loved the food and service here, the only downside was the decor was dissappointing and the prices are a bit high (about $30 for an entree.
93	0	1	we had dinner at becco on a friday night, and were seated in the left bar area, which while pretty crowded, had a manageable noise level.
94	0	0	Don't go if you want a serene environment to go with your sushi.
95	0	0	It's in a less travelled spot on 3rd, but the intimate setting is great and romantic.
96	0	0	the place has an awesome decore, with fish swiming below certain tables.
97	0	0	The atmosphere couldn't be better, and the service was outstanding -- at the time there were only two people working the entire bar, and we still got taken care of like it was a five star restaurant.
98	0	0	The atmosphere is perfect, whether sitting down for dinner or just having a drink at the bar and engaging the friendly bartenders in converasation.
99	0	1	This is the kind of place that is suppose to have pushy waiters and a loud atmosphere.
100	0	0	Nice decor poor food poor service.
101	0	1	Atmosphere, I'd give to Rosa or Maya, but Mexican fare at Zarela is tops.
102	0	1	The atmosphere's a bit grungy, yes, but the music and the coffee are good.
103	0	1	If you want a quiet dinner don't show up late, cuz the atmosphere gets louder and more loungy as the nite goes on.
104	0	1	I had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the price paid, I expected it to have some type of flavor.
105	0	1	You may as well just extend the bar into the restaurant since it has already penetrated it with loud music, loud voices, and a remarkable amount of cigarette smoke.
106	0	0	The atmosphere is nice, food is really worth it, especially for such prices, but service sucks:  I first ordered 2 different martinis and never got the one I asked for;  they brought the wrong dishes -although it was quick!- and then we had to ask for chopsticks to be able to eat our dishes.
107	0	1	I tried several dishes, while at dinner with friends, and was amazed to discover that even their Caesar Salad was completely lacking in flavor.
108	0	0	The basil pepper mojito was a little daunting in concept, but I was refreshed at the flavor.
109	0	0	The atmosphere of the place is nice as well as the location, but I found food mediocre and too expensive for the quality offered.
110	0	0	Very pleasant atmosphere, not a quiet romantic dinner.
111	0	1	The veal was nice and tender, but the flavors weren't exciting.
112	0	1	Noise level is high, and if you are a non smoker ask to be seated away from the bar.
113	0	0	The attention to detail whether it's decor or service or menu made us feel fortunate to be part of the Camino Sur dining experience.
114	0	1	The environment is a touch loud (although the music's good), but the walls sport nifty vintage items, from license plates to pennants to movie posters.
115	0	1	The two cons were the lack of information on the menus (they had just sushi roll names, with no description of their contents, printed in a bland format), and music selection, which didn't fit the ambiance.
116	0	0	i thought the food was great but kind of expensive for that atmosphere, the tables were too close and it was too noisy.
117	0	1	I went here for a dinner with some relatives from out of town that I was eager to catch up with, but the noise level at this place made that really difficult!
118	0	1	The service was good and the price was decent but it wasn't enough to overcome the bland tasting food and the bland decor of the restaurant.
119	0	0	Taci then moved to NYU, to a space as warm as an igloo, with an equally cold atmosphere, an attempt at a more upscale menu, and with all the charm of a pizza joint.
120	0	0	and although the service is a little slow, the lax atmosphere allows you to drink and eat away the afternoon or evening and not even care.
121	0	0	We sat in the garden out back, and the calm atmosphere with the waterfall rock wall on the side completed the setting.
122	0	0	While the environment is still fun and diverse, the food quality has been sliding lately.
123	0	0	Good atmosphere, the service is so-so and there is a long wait if you don't have reservations.
124	0	0	I would say it's suitable for a romantic date or quiet family meal, as there is no bar so the atmosphere is a little quiet.
125	0	0	The restauarnt is Ok in terms of decor, but the food was really lacking - things were not cooked to order.
126	0	1	Not the most beautiful environment, but the food is consistently delicious and the barbeque is fun and tasty.
127	0	0	The entertainment is awesome - and believe it or not, I was so impressed with one of their musicians/singers (named Alessandro) that I even had him play during my cocktail hour.
128	0	0	Dim, candlelit dining room is accented by a funky star pointed bar and multi-colored ceiling lamps, with trendy upbeat music in the background.
129	0	1	The decor isn't the best and the place is very modest, but if you're around Ditmars Blvd.
130	0	1	The only apparent flavor in any of the dishes was heat, and a table of four gourmands left at least half of our meals on our plates.
131	0	1	Not the best ambience and the service is sometimes just mediocre, but the quality of the food is incredible.
132	0	0	The Scene The consistent lines at this bustling Japanese tapas hot spot don't lie: Yokocho's fresh, reasonably priced comfort food and social atmosphere draw a youthful clientele of cultural natives and gaijin alike.
133	0	0	The Food There's no need to slump into a well-known comfort zone of teriyaki and udon.
134	0	0	Overall, I would rather go to a chain coffee house up the street for the same priced coffee, but a much more relaxing atmosphere, and no one forgetting my order.
135	0	1	Don't expect trendy atmosphere: room looks like it could have been designed in 1940s, but who cares - it's actually comfortable and inviting; with great food and unbeatable value, you can't go wrong.
136	0	0	The pizza is baked in a wood burning oven and the flavor is fantastic.
137	0	0	The Scene Cooing couples find some formality and open air up in the front room, while the subterranean back area offers hunkered-down seating for loungier dining.
138	0	0	same atmosphere but food was better before years ago- octopus was like chewing a rubber tire- dumplings tasted artificial.
139	0	0	The atmosphere was so fun that we decided to have another cocktail at the bar and enjoy the scene.
140	0	0	Forget about the staff and go for the food and pleasant, if a bit cramped Lancaster, Pennsylvania like decor for comfort.
141	0	0	The food is just ok, not really memorable and not what you expect for the price but I guess the atmosphere is what you pay for.
142	0	1	I'm totally into the space-age vibe of this place, but I wish they had more tables to sit down at.
143	0	0	We waited at the bar for only 10 minutes (we had a reservation) - can't complain about that, the restaurant was full and I enjoyed the lively atmosphere and music.
144	0	1	The decor is not special at all but their food and amazing prices make up for it.
145	0	1	Granted we were just the girls, but this would also be a great date spot b/c the ambiance is chic and bustling yet you can also hear the conversation at your own table rather than a loud din or worse, someone else's conversation.
146	0	0	In the front bar, boisterous neighbors and friends share bottles of wine; the large dining room, with its lovely painted ceiling and oversized portrait of a portly chef, is the destination for serious eating.
147	0	0	Comfort standbys--including bacon-wrapped meat loaf and barbecued ribs, and upscaled interpretations--like tuna club made with wasabi mayo, share space with brunch favorites (Belgian waffles, fluffy buttermilk pancakes and wrecked eggs, or tofu).
148	0	1	I ordered dessert and it was they gave me the wrong flavor of ice cream.
149	0	0	The Scene You won't blink twice at the restaurant's spartan decor: As the packed crowds and critics' praises wallpapering the front wall agree, this longtime local favorite is truly one of the area's most exquisite finds.
150	0	0	At least the entertainment was free, as we were able to witness one customer wooing a waitress, and another being drenched in milk.
151	0	0	Meat wasn't fall-off-the bone (a sign of over-cooking) but was tender and had deep flavor.
152	0	0	I thought the bar was fair in terms of decor, but how long do you have wait at the bar before a bartender with an attitude (he wasn't rude, but not friendly) makes you an awful drink, but food was delightful and music light and tasty as well.
153	0	0	maybe its the cost of top ingredients but 17.
154	0	0	The restaurant has a somewhat unique decor, with portrait of the owner meditating and books about meditation.
155	0	1	The Crystal Ballroom was closed for a private party, so we couldn't even enjoy the decor.
156	0	0	The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.
157	0	1	In addition, they lack basic ammenities like a toaster, and the decor was shabby, at best.
158	0	0	The ambience is extremely romantic, even if you get seated upstairs.
159	0	0	It still took a little while to get our drinks and food - But the atmosphere made up for it.
160	0	1	It's not going to win any awards for its decor, but the food is good, the portions are big, and the prices are low.
161	0	0	the atmosphere is that of a diner, but if you get a booth that is the best!
162	0	1	Basically the comfort is lacking but the food is the focus.
163	0	0	The bar area got a little too crowded but the ambiance was great.
164	0	0	I absolutely hate communal seating and closely spaced tables and this place had both, but the atmosphere and the food were such that I was able to get beyond the grumpy mood that put me in to have a really good experience.
165	0	0	The atmosphere is still to die for, but the wine list has so clearly been pared down and marked up (as a result of higher foot traffic brought in by lots of rave reviews in local publications, perhaps?
166	0	0	Not only is it the nicest atmosphere with an antique bar and allabaster globes sconces, marble fireplace.
167	0	0	The Scene Honeycomb-colored walls, random wall art, a peek into the kitchen from paper-topped tables--all combine for a casual, thrown-together ambience.
168	0	1	The music is a little bit louder, but the food is excellent.
169	0	0	It's sad that everything about this place was great (even the service and decor) except for the steak.
170	0	0	The mole sauce is not too sweet and adds a nice flavor to the otherwise bland chicken.
171	0	1	went here w/ great expectations and was greatly disappointed; the food was good, not great and vastly overpriced- one salad, two pasta dishes, two demi-carafes of red wine- $100 (tax and tip); rediculous; orechiette came w/ so little brocoli rape that it did not have its characteristic flavor; and it is very very loud.
172	0	1	Two Tom's food is excellent, it more than makes up for the lack of decor.
173	0	0	Yes, this place is good, a cut above some of the other local diner food and a nice, friendly atmosphere.
174	0	0	Nice ambience and bar while waiting for a table.
175	0	1	Overall, the food makes up for what is missing in the ambience and service.
176	0	0	However the casual atmosphere comes in handy if you want a good place to drop in and get food.
177	0	1	Desserts were visually inventive but lacking in flavor.
178	0	0	Unfortunately the food and the service don't live up to the spectacular setting.
179	0	0	I liked the overall setting A LOT and it was only improved by the fact that our waiter was pleasant and attentive even though we only ordered entrees (no drinks, no appetizers, no coffee).
180	0	0	It is a nice diner atmosphere, they have booths all around and a couple of middle tables.
181	0	1	Overall,it's a good place to have dinner and hang out if you do not mind waiting for food,weird music and rude manager.
182	0	0	The strong suit of this place is the decor, alas we was seated and served by some guy who looked like he was out of a seedy 70's porn movie and everything went downhill after.
183	0	0	They did a great job on the decor but it seems that the food has gotten a bit less in the quality department, as well as in the portion size!
184	0	0	The ambience is cool, and the cocktails might be worth coming by, but head somewhere else for dinner.
185	0	0	Dishes feature intriguing names, and interesting combinations of fresh ingredients.
186	0	1	What it lacks in decor it more than makes up in the cuisine.
187	0	1	The decor was mediocre and honestly, I can get a better brunch at a Cracker Barrel restaurant.
188	0	0	(try the Queso Fundido and fire) Upstairs there is a dining room which is decorated with brightly colored mexican theme.
189	0	0	The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad.
190	0	0	The store has a great atmosphere amd amazing staff who are always there to help if its a cup of coffee or a nice chat.
191	0	0	The only drawback was slow service, but the food and ambience are so nice that your wait is A) pleasant and B) worth it.
192	0	1	I went on a saturday and the atmosphere was no more exciting than eating dinner at home.
193	0	0	the place had open doors and windows and a very relaxed, candle-lit type of atmosphere.
194	0	0	If you're not looking for a pretentious atmosphere and a restaurant that serves the best steak you've ever eaten.
195	0	1	Upon entering Alta the bar and restaurant decor ironically misguide the patron.
196	0	1	In Short Many Murray Hill locals gladly overlook the dull green walls and fluorescent lighting for Jaiya's quick and affordable Thai cooking--if not, they take meals to go or get them delivered.
197	0	1	The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.
198	0	0	Although I usually go out mid-week for lunch, I now make it a habit to stop out Thursday or Friday evening to enjoy the live Jazz band.
199	0	0	Too bad the food and service aren't nearly as nice as the decor.
200	0	1	The ambience was all wrong, the bar opened into the main dining room causing the noise to flow into the room.
201	0	1	Let me count the problems: music so loud it hurt, sticky unclean tables, the waitress took a long time to take our order, and then didn't bring a glass for the beer.
202	0	1	Music was blasting (speakers located practically on top of every table), and we asked the waitress if they can turn it down.
203	0	0	Patrons can choose to be seated in the front room with a little more activity and more of a bar feel or in one of the 2 back rooms which both offer slightly quieter, more relaxed environments.
204	0	0	the best thing is the atmosphere, but even that is overshadowed by the lack of taste and originality in the food.
205	0	0	I like how the ambiance changes from the cafeteria style of lunch to a sit down dinner in romantic lighting.
206	0	0	I would say that the atmosphere was nothing amazing, I didn't feel like the authenticity of the history of the place was nearly as prevelant as it could have been in the experience.
207	0	0	An unpretentious sexy atmosphere lends itself to the above average wine-list and a menu that can stand-up to any other restaurant in NewYork City (or Paris).
208	0	1	The decor there is nothing special, though somehow the service manages to deal with the large crowds in an efficient, friendly manner.
209	0	0	Get some drinks and listen to the free live music.
210	0	0	The ambience is diner-like and the wait staff is rushed, but at these prices, I can't complain.
211	0	0	I lived next door and loved to go down for a drink at their uplit marble bar under the beautiful lighting or sit by the fireplace when the live band is not playing.
212	0	0	Most of the food has a vinegary flavor (I think because of the injera).
213	0	0	While the design of the space and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable (with a great view of Union Square), the food has once again proved to be less than favorable and the service mediocre.
214	0	1	I think they just tried to get a little too creative with the menu and actually ended up losing flavor in some of the dishes.
215	0	1	They were playing top 40 music the day I went which just didn't work with the whole theme, but they had the trippy sci-fi music playing in the bathroom, so it was almost right.
216	0	0	Come-as-you-are atmosphere, jukebox, value and James behind the bar work as a magnet.
217	0	1	Management had always been rude, but without the great staff as a buffer, Jesse's is just another pubby place with poor decor and average food.
218	0	0	Having just returned from Bourbon Street, I thought I had experienced the steepest drink prices in the US, but this is worse than N'awlins, where at least the expensive drinks cover wonderful live music.
219	0	1	The atmosphere is bland and non-descript and the service is fine.
220	0	0	The atmosphere is fun -- dark, pulsing, basement room; a place where you feel like you can relax.
221	0	1	The Scene There are two distinct personalities to the place: The loud, seemingly always-crowded bar with hanging paper decorations and dim lighting, and the two main dining areas, where the noise level and decor is notably more subdued.
222	0	0	Although the decor is lovely as usual, service has detiorated.
223	0	0	But it's the ambience that is the draw for me---sipping red wine and sitting under the red awning on a warm night.
224	0	0	They may love the wacky/tacky decore, the overly gracious host, Gus, and his staff, the loads of freebies (oranges, cookies, lollies and wet naps), but the food is just mediocre.
225	0	0	Decor is old, but the bathrooms are clean and updated.
226	0	0	Atmosphere in the formal room was nice, but the informal dining room was extremely loud which ultimately made the formal room louder than my perference.
227	0	1	Additionally the bar upstairs is picturesque and spacious, even though the techno music is horrible.
228	0	0	on the food-front while adding just enough of a civilized atmosphere where you won't worry about either your neighbor or the wait staff biting off one of your fingers.
229	0	0	I love the decor but would not recommend sitting in the communal tables unless its a very big group, much more fun getting a table and people watch while you chomp on your $20 palm sized truffle pizza.
230	0	1	It's too loud and the cheesiest music is played throughout the meal.
231	0	0	The pro's: Good ambience,service The Con's: For the 4 to 5 star price (200 dollars for 2 people which included 2 drinks each, an appetizer, main course, and a hsared dessert), the food and presentation was just average.
232	0	0	I've been here twice for brunch, and I found the ambience and food to be much better than the overly-hyped Kitchenette next door.
233	0	0	The food was good, the service was fine, and the place has a lot of visual atmosphere, but I would not go back unless I was stuck eating with someone I didn't want to listen to.
234	0	0	Nice decor - but the place is so crowded and noisy you can't enjoy it.
235	0	0	Aside from the service being slow, the place was packed w/ a good crowd and music was amazing.
236	0	1	I mean no disrespect to the owner, just constructive criticism - improve the decor and dine-in service, but DON'T change the portions or the recipes.
237	0	0	Recommended to those who want to try a different setting for a diner.
238	0	0	it is too bad because the food, ambiance, and drinks were great but they need serious help on the service.
239	0	0	Come in the evening, sip a glass of wine, or two, and enjoy the great live jazz along with your dinner.
240	0	1	Don't go for the decor or the location, go for the food!
241	0	0	The Scene Behind the often-fogged windows at this small restaurant is a homey atmosphere, full of smiling employees and Filipino families crowded around simple red tables.
242	0	0	Start by enjoying the atmosphere while having a glass of wine at the bar and we you are ready, go and enjoy your food!
243	0	0	The place is a little over-priced for brunch but it is a nice restaurant so that was expected Food (i had the omelette with cheddar, mushrooms and herbs), service, coffee, atmosphere were all fantastic.
244	0	0	Super friendly neighboorhood atmosphere where even a lady can go alone and have a drink and feel comfortable.
245	0	0	SQC is great in the evening, the light is excellent and it's perfect to sit at the bar, eat oysters on the half shell and have a glass of wine.
246	0	1	Although the atmosphere was lacking, I could definitely recommend a trip to Esca for the fish alone!
247	0	0	The Scene North Square's discreet, sedate decor appeals to the largley older crowd occupying the dining room whilst a younger set parties in the back bar.
248	0	1	Great roofdeck, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet.
249	0	0	About 10 of us came here for drinks last friday, the atmosphere was good for chatting and hanging out, but not enough lounge or bar space, they should open up the back area w/ more loungable chairs or booths if they want to catch any after dinner sort of bar crowd.
250	0	0	The atmosphere was fun and if you sit by the window, there is a lot of people-watching to be had!
251	0	0	At dinner on a Saturday night, I was enthused by the bustling, unpretentious crowd and the lusciously warm lighting.
252	0	0	And the ambience is very cool, stop by on a Saturday afternoon and you can play some old school games while having a beer.
253	0	0	Superfine is my preferred destination in the city when I'm looking for a casual, hip atmosphere, extraordinary food at decent prices and/or just a place to get a good drink, chat with the bartender and shoot some (free) pool.
254	0	0	I left feeling unsatisfied, except for having a nice chance to people watch in the cozy atmosphere with my over-priced pasta bolognese.
255	0	1	The food is average, however the service is way below average (our waiter was a stuttering fool when it came to the specials and left our drinks empty for the majority of the night) The atmostphere is cheesy as well as the crowd.
256	0	0	Nice family place, nice atmosphere, but don't go there for pizza.
257	0	0	I don't have much to say about the cafe itself; you can order out from the family-run cafe in the front, or take a seat in the back, which opens up to the outdoors and can offer a less seedy and more homey atmosphere.
258	0	0	From making the reservation (not required) to the before dinner drink (cava), to the table (romantic), to the the ambiance (candles, spanish antiques, etc) to the food of course (original, incredibly deep and rich in flavor) to our departure and saying goodnight to the waiter.
259	0	1	The noise level is equivalent to a sports bar.
260	0	1	I had to wait 1hr since I got there around 8pm but you could have a few drinks by the bar since the ambiance is very loungy/ club like.
261	0	0	The atmosphere was embracing and enticing and the costs of the meal, $45 to $55 in value.
262	0	0	Once dinner ended the party really started going inside they were playing great music.
263	0	0	We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.
264	0	1	Zero decor, this is not a date place--just a great place to get a quick, tasty and cheap meal.
265	0	0	The place has a sort of trendy pseudo-asian decor that seems perfectly casual or romantic.
266	0	1	The Food Chef-owner Tom Valenti's food makes just as much noise; he cooks in a masculine, big-flavored, meat-and-potatoes style, rich with terrines, mustards, eggs and bitter greens.
267	0	1	Don't let the ambiance of this place fool you, the food is far better than many pricey establishments.
268	0	1	Noisy atmosphere makes the place even more fun, though it may become hard to get in after 5PM on Friday- almost every table would be reserved.
269	0	0	My friends and I had a great time - the atmosphere was exciting but didn't encroach on us while we had our meal and drinks (which is better, the kiwitini or the watermelon martini?)
270	0	0	The ambiance and service is great but I wish I could say the same about the food.
271	0	0	Fantastic flavor, but certainly not worth the high price of the small glass.
272	0	1	I ordered the flounder special - the fish was fresh but the dish lacked flavor.
273	0	0	ambience and decoration was nice but for a check of $330 for 5 for brunch and with just average food.
274	0	0	This place basically has the same menu as Penang but everything is cheaper, including the atmosphere.
275	0	1	Nothing too special about the location or the atmosphere, but DAMN, the pizza is good.
276	0	1	The waiters are sometimes grouchy and the decor doesn't change, but the food is always delicious and satisfying.
277	0	0	from the white sheets that hang when you come into the restaurant, to the gorgeous marble communal table in the center of the bottom floor, to the great atmosphere upstairs at the bar.
278	0	0	The ambience is simple, yet elegant and be sure to finish your meal with their famous shlog.
279	0	1	The decor is a little plain and the seating is a touch too close but its worth it for the food.
280	0	0	The atmosphere is nice - it's all dark wood with the bar in the front.
281	0	1	The food at Forest Hills was great, the service more than perfect, but but the ambience was too hot they do not have AC and the employes was sweating a lot , it was a nasty esxperience because I eat in front of the service that was sweating like animals.
282	0	0	There was a nice atmosphere except for the few pompous patrons who looked way too gaudy or a lunch time meal, but overall its a great place to eat.
283	0	1	The service was good, if a little slow, and the place was very crowded (which can be comforting, but on a date it may be hard with the constant noise).
284	0	0	Fun atmosphere, good beer selection, but meals were skimpy portions on big plates and the service was weak - never had the same server/waitperson come back twice.
285	0	0	Cute decor, but rather small so the dining room can get very smoky if the bar is crowded.
286	0	1	Even though the food was prepared nicely, it was definitely lacking flavor.
287	0	0	They draw you in with a fancy looking decore which obviously cost a mint, ply you with overpriced wines (one bottle I knew was a 6$and they had the nerve to charge 40) This place sufferes from the same problem Areos does, it rests on its reputation.
288	0	1	Basically, all the food on the menu is a half-ass'd attempt at vietnamese food, followed by a innappropriate heap of MSG to make up for the lack of any flavor.
289	0	0	Very cheesy wanna be romantic decor and entertainment, but have some vodka and you want to come right out onto the dance floor and dance the night away to a mix of really bad russian and american disco music.
290	0	0	after dinner we went downstairs atmosphere was completely different , nice crowd , we stayed there more time than expected.
291	0	1	Flavors range from standards to hard-to-find Italian options, like tiramisu, hazelnut and zuppa inglese.
292	0	0	The decor is worth a mention, with plush seating areas that range from bar stools to table/chair combos to full sofa areas.
293	0	1	Although the wait staff was friendly, the atmosphere was not.
294	0	1	The wine list is good, and overall it is not too expensive, though, and the atmosphere is very dark and brick-covered, much like any damp basement.
295	0	1	While the service and setting were average, the food was excellent.
296	0	0	The food is decent, average bistro food, the decor is nice, but the service is poor, the waiters always seems to have to many tables andcant keep up with a good services.
297	0	0	Although the prices are kind of high for lunch the atmosphere is nice.
298	0	0	The atmosphere could be considered amiable, if you possess roguish frat-boy nostalgia.
299	0	0	The food was simple but exploded with flavor and the presentation was as if it was out of a cook book.
300	0	0	The Sushi was of the highest caliber, the cut as if a master samurai marks smith was behind the bar, and service, just what you would expect from a fine dining establishment, New York style.
301	0	0	I will be back not only because the price was so unbelievable but the atmosphere was just plain COOL and the food was spectacular.
302	0	0	Appetizers and entrees were merely adequate, but you can't beat the pool room for atmosphere.
303	0	0	This place is so very nearly achieving, but in the mean time, my advice - eat early elsewhere, then take your seat, order a bottle of wine and enjoy the performance and the ambience.
304	0	1	It is now nothing but an overpriced establishment that is shamelessly riding on the coat tails of its past.
305	0	0	The atmosphere was wonderful, however the service and food were not.
306	0	1	The piano guy isn't there all the time, but when he is it's a great addition to the meal.
307	0	1	Oh, and kudos to the hostess who appeared out of thin air with extra napkins just moments after a glass of water was knocked over - she's upping the bar on service here.
308	0	1	The noise here is so bad that people entered and left without ordering and they lowered the lights during the dinner.
309	0	1	Sure, the burgers are good, but not good enough to make up for the abominable service and disgusting, filthy atmosphere.
310	0	0	I went here all 4 years that I lived in the area, and being a not-so-loaded student, it was a great place to go for some good sushi and a very pleasant comforting atmosphere.
311	0	1	Odd, traditional and clashing decor will only detract from your experience if the square box layout or perma-draft through the pane glass door doesn't get you first.
312	0	0	We went to the Sunday brunch, and were pleasantly surprised to find a jazz combo there.
313	0	1	I came to celebrate finishing my third year of med school and was greatly disappointed by the way I was treated at the door (rude and terse), the food (mediocre), and the ambiance (very loud, crowded, and uncomfortable close to our neighbors despite the large room).
314	0	0	the decor could be a bit better, and if there was a small bar the overall atmosphere would be a bit more inviting (especially for regulars).
315	0	1	You're not going there for the decor you're going there for the best freeking pizza on the face of this earth and I garuntee you Dom delivers big time!
316	0	1	Costs could be better - expect to be upsold by the hovering wait staff - and come for the authentic tastes, not the interior decor (looked a littel like Cheers!
317	0	1	True, the ambiance is something out of Goodfellas, but it the food and waiters are out of this world!
318	0	1	It took us about 30 minutes to get seated, the burgers came without lettuce, they brougt us the wrong drinks, and the flavor of the burgers were below average.
319	0	0	great decor, unfortunately the worst service possible.
320	0	0	The Scene This vintage Cuban diner, with white acrylic tables, soft Spanish music humming pleasantly in the background and regulars casually hugging the counter, serves some of the cheapest, tastiest fare in the area.
321	0	1	The decor has not quite made the transition--some really nice artifacts are still there, but there are several layers of different remodeling efforts visible.
322	0	0	Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.
323	0	0	The ambience is stunning and the food is really good, but the portions are RIDICULOUSLY small.
324	0	1	The decor is nothing great to speak of, but who cares - the food is top notch.
325	0	1	As the night rolls on the place turns into a bar/lounge so the wait staff is constantly rushing you to eat up and move out, not the kind of atmosphere you want for the price you are paying for your entree.
326	0	1	who seemed honestly offended that we asked why our table was 45 minutes late; a cold cafeteria room that was clearly designed to intimidate; and haute chinese food that was over-salted to make up for the lack of flavor.
327	0	0	The atmosphere is warmly dim and inviting - if you make a reservation, ask for a corner both for extra coziness!
328	0	1	I must admit that when my friend said we were going to Astoria for dinner, I expected a diner sytle restaurant, where the decor, food and service would not suffice.
329	0	1	The red sauce had no flavor, the cheese lacked that fresh quality cheese taste you expect from a well-known pizzaria, and the slice overall was really dry.
330	0	0	The overpriced food that's supposed to come off as homestyle diner just doesn't work when the atmosphere is supposed to be super cool but the food is super bland.
331	0	0	As a chef I really appreciated the well executed dishes that were full of crisp and vibrant flavor contrast acting in harmony and perfect balance.
332	0	1	The ambience isn't great but the food is so tasty and so reasonably priced that it's definitely a fun date place if you want to get a bunch of stuff and sample.
333	0	0	Despite a lovely atmosphere, this was perhaps the worst dining experience I've had in New York.
334	0	1	The decor and the service definitely is not the greatest, but I can overlook those things since their food is just so damn good.
335	0	0	the trendy atmosphere and high price fooled me into thinking that somehow the food would be innovative.
