122	6	0	Very fast and good for most steam games.
123	6	1	Yes, it's running and old type processor so, hey, don't even try gaming on it.
124	6	0	But, if you are just an average user, it works really great.
125	6	1	And the settings are simply annoying.
126	6	1	It came with no instruction book - no back up CD's and has already crashed.
127	6	0	It's great for what he uses it for.
128	6	1	plus - no russian input ??  wtf
129	6	0	What a great laptop, I can run my games and work really fast.
130	6	0	Also, the resale value on this will keep.
131	6	0	I play Sims 4 and 3 on it all the time, with very little issues.
132	6	0	I bought this pc to play games and stream movies! it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd!
133	6	0	This laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing.
134	6	1	The speakers are fairly basic, so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies.
135	6	0	If you draw on the other hand i'm sure you will love using this in tablet mode.
136	6	0	- It can run games really well.
137	6	0	The Mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized, lazy, and eye candy person in all of us.
138	6	1	I would've given 5 stars, had it not been for the hours of updates I've had to do to this upon arrival.

142	6	0	It makes it much more exciting to play!
143	6	0	This computer is a fantastic tool for word processing, searching the internet, and keeping track of everyday life.
144	6	1	It has a 128 GB storage capacity (but with the option of a 256 GB hard drive) and a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, so don't expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too.
145	6	1	I would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase.
146	6	1	The other Issue I had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it.
147	6	0	Awesome laptop for college!!!
148	6	0	Can be used for gaming as well.
149	6	0	I can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed.
150	6	0	I usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing, so the entry-level 13' MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for.
151	6	0	This laptop was made for art, music, beat-making, pictures, movies, graphic design.
152	6	0	The MacBook Pro is useful for college students for many reasons:
153	6	1	Maybe I'm not being reasonable, but I don't feel that's the same as a new computer because I didn't pay for a refurbished computer.
154	6	1	Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag, and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs.
155	6	1	I'm a designer turned front-end developer and this computer is unusable for front-end development.
156	6	1	When I had a boot up issue, the HP recovery didn't work.
157	6	1	The disks I made wouldn't work.....HP support stated &quot;we're a hardware company, not a software company.&quot;
158	6	1	I have not tried gaming on it but I have heard that Mac/Apple does not do games well.
159	6	0	For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop.
160	6	0	It doesn't have a lot of frills, but I didn't need any, and being able to buy what I needed, and not more than I needed was very important.
161	6	0	It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer.
162	6	1	I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.
163	6	1	Games being the main issue.
164	6	0	This computer is good for anything, and it has really superseded my high expectations.
165	6	0	The HD display is sensational, and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me.
166	6	0	At my age, I need this kind of laptop.
167	6	0	More than enough for my use.
168	6	0	I liked the fact that it came with Windows 7, but also included Windows 8 to install later if I need it.
169	6	0	I was nervous at first that I purchased a lemon but the user manual explains how to turn on the keyboard  backlight.
170	6	0	I bought this for my daughter to use for school and homework, it's not a "fast" computer, but it's great for what she needs it for and very light weight!
