101	8	1	Even though MacBooks are expensive, you will see that they are well worth the money.
102	8	1	While the price may seem high, it is worth every penny with its many perks.
103	8	0	-  With that being said, for the price ($800!), you get a nice fast laptop, but if you ask me, it's missing some things that I feel should be automatically included:
104	8	0	It's a steal when considering the specs and performance as well.
105	8	0	By the way...I paid for this particular laptop roughly 2 grand...LOOK AT THE PRICE NOW!
106	8	1	Only thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality!
107	8	0	It is the cheapest product in the line of MacBook's
108	8	0	Battery doesn't hold up to what it said in the description but I got it refurb'd and I imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price (Just a guess).
109	8	1	I would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy.
110	8	1	Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag, and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs.
111	8	1	This, added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money, detracts from the computer's value.
112	8	1	Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer.
113	8	1	You get what you pay for, right?
114	8	1	Now that they are not virus free ([...]l) I see absolutely no benefit to Apple products as they are slower, more expensive, and do not last as long.
115	8	0	I gave this product 5 stars because I have been looking for a MacBook Pro for a long time and I found it here for a wonderful price.
116	8	1	If the price doesn't deter you, you'll find it well worth it in terms of trouble-free operation.
