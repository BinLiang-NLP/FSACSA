232	7	1	This clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered.
233	7	1	It would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for 5 minutes.
234	7	1	The second one, after a little over a month, refused to turn on even with a full charge.

238	7	1	I barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load.
239	7	1	It's clunky, heavy, and a pain to start up and shut down.

259	7	0	I'm very happy with it, typing on it right now and it is fast enough for that!
260	7	1	Also, when you try to download a large file, like a video, it will start out normally, downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec, making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless.
261	7	1	It came with no instruction book - no back up CD's and has already crashed.
262	7	1	Now the speed is disappointing.
263	7	1	Start up is fine  maybe 20 secs at most, but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times.
264	7	1	Even for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open.
265	7	0	Also, I have no regrets about going with the 8GB RAM because its super fast.

289	7	0	Very quick to get it up and running with a minimum setup time right after you open the box.
290	7	1	The first one arrived and it did not work.

297	7	0	The screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down.

301	7	0	Machine is flying and with parallels desktop 8 I have my old PC notebook completely functional on my MBP.
302	7	0	-  With that being said, for the price ($800!), you get a nice fast laptop, but if you ask me, it's missing some things that I feel should be automatically included:
303	7	0	All works beautifully but Windows 8 is taking a bit of getting used to.
304	7	0	It's light, fast and has great battery!!
305	7	0	It's a steal when considering the specs and performance as well.
306	7	0	I can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed.
307	7	0	This thing boots in just a few seconds which is nice.
308	7	0	Boot time is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute.
309	7	0	Furthermore, Mac OS X Mountain Lion's Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans, which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed.
310	7	1	Very pour performance.
311	7	1	It takes for ever to wake it up.
312	7	1	Sometimes It stops receiving wifi signal, so I have to restart it.
313	7	1	It is very slow and not responsive.
314	7	0	I tested it, it worked great.
315	7	1	He received it, and one day later it DIES.
316	7	1	The laptop refuses to start, we have troubleshooted all areas, still fails to start.
317	7	1	Cannot even get to bios.
318	7	1	Just a click and a BLACK SCREEN.
319	7	1	We got two days of operation from this laptop.
320	7	0	The machine now has 10 gigs of RAM and it works just fine.
321	7	0	Three years ago I had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great!
322	7	0	2. 8 gig ram needed if you are as productive as I am (DJ, photography, movie making, etc) its quick!
323	7	1	2. Sometimes when I stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on, other times it is a few seconds
324	7	0	Mine has been though hundreds of parties, weddings, quinces, anything involving performances, it can take it!
325	7	0	If you are looking for a light, durable, and extremely effecient laptop, buy this one!
326	7	0	Pros:  o It usually runs very smoothly, but Apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers.
327	7	1	Computer seemed sluggish for an Intel Core i5 device.
328	7	0	Runs fast, the touch screen hasn't lost any sensitivity, I'm overall very happy with it.
329	7	1	I still have weird freezing problems with it and it's pretty slow, but it's not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in.
330	7	0	I am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the MAC!
331	7	0	Well she was right, Whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works.
332	7	0	The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution.
333	7	1	Before and after I resolved that issue, I saw the damn 'beachball' all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it's doing while I wait for it.
334	7	1	I spend so much time waiting for it.
335	7	1	Now that they are not virus free ([...]l) I see absolutely no benefit to Apple products as they are slower, more expensive, and do not last as long.
336	7	0	If the price doesn't deter you, you'll find it well worth it in terms of trouble-free operation.
337	7	1	From time to time I get the 'spinning beach ball' that holds up progress.
