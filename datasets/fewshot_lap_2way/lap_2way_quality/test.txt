36	9	1	I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.
37	9	1	Long story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.

53	9	1	The computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it.
54	9	1	One year of trying to fix the computer by myself, with help of friends, and even help from computer experts I have given up on trying to fix it.
55	9	1	THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE----BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY.

58	9	0	The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful.
59	9	0	It is everything I'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy.
60	9	1	I actually had the hard drive replaced twice, the mother board once, the dvd drive twice, then they FINALLY agreed to replace it, (ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS!)only to get another "HP/Compaq" piece of crap.

66	9	0	i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go.
67	9	0	The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.
68	9	1	Took it back as it was defective.
69	9	1	think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop.
70	9	0	Amazing Quality!
71	9	1	Second, it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated

74	9	0	It runs very quiet too which is a plus.

83	9	1	STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up.
84	9	1	Apparently there is a manufacturing defect, something with the amount of thermal paste.
85	9	1	But if you can't make your product last more than a year, you will not get my business again.
86	9	0	In the three years I've had my MacBook Pro, I have never had a virus on my computer, and I do a lot of work on the internet.
87	9	1	Needs constant repair.
88	9	1	I feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it.
89	9	0	With awesome graphics and assuring security, it's perfect!
90	9	0	I've never had problems with viruses.
91	9	1	From the build quality to the performance, everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple.
92	9	1	The system constantly overheats, the battery life is too short, the case is coming apart, and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly.
93	9	0	Really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints.
94	9	0	Never been hacked.
95	9	0	No viruses.

98	9	1	Ive had to call tech support many times.

100	9	0	With a mac you don't have to worry about antivirus software or firewall, it's so wonderful.
101	9	0	this computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.
102	9	1	I spent 2200 dollars on a "top of the line laptop".
103	9	1	I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it.
104	9	1	1) Payed $2200 for a "premium" laptop
105	9	1	2) Blue screen first month
106	9	1	so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.
107	9	1	I had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair.
108	9	1	COMPUTER HAS BEEN AT SERVICE FACILITY MORE THAN IN MY HANDS.
109	9	1	To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.
110	9	1	Also, I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot, and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.
111	9	1	The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty.
112	9	1	During that time, I had to send it back 3 times.
113	9	1	I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.
114	9	1	I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.
115	9	1	in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
116	9	1	5 months dead again.
117	9	1	They are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat.

121	9	1	Unable to boot up this brand new laptop.
122	9	0	The 13" MacBook Pro is portable, durable, and very capable.
123	9	0	They also have a longer service life than other computers (I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).
124	9	0	It's face and depanable.
125	9	0	I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems!
126	9	1	I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
127	9	1	The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.
128	9	1	Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth, they come loose.
129	9	1	And it is impossible to get them back in.
130	9	1	Didn't expect to repair it at once!
131	9	0	I have never had any issues or problems with my MacBook Pro so far, and it is still as fast as it was when I first bought it.

135	9	0	The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile.
136	9	1	This computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life.
137	9	1	Everything is falling apart internally and externally.
138	9	1	With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down.
139	9	0	It is very well built.
140	9	0	I look forward to years of use, it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well.
141	9	1	And I'm still paying the bloody financing, for a product which didn't last me at least three years !
142	9	1	Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if, since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it's "like new," I might have 8 months next time.
143	9	1	I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.
144	9	1	Dell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine.
145	9	0	I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it.
146	9	1	It seems that this computer might be a lemon.
147	9	1	But if you buy this i would highly recommend that you buy a case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile.
148	9	0	All the sturdy and substantial feel you expect from a Thinkpad.
149	9	0	Outstanding laptop and very well built.

161	9	0	I am also glad it doesnt get too hot when left on for an extended period of time.
162	9	1	A masterpiece of crap.
163	9	1	not durable .
164	9	0	They have held up well not just in our sales department, but also in our service department where they are exposed to dust, exhaust, grease, oil, and all manner of other non-computer-friendly substances.
165	9	0	GENERAL, a quality laptop.
166	9	0	Apple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality.
167	9	0	Overall, a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer.

172	9	0	Look and feel is good.
173	9	0	A good value on a quality product.

176	9	0	The computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch.
177	9	0	Sound, quality and touchscreen are awesome!
178	9	0	My favorite colors black and red, the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard.
179	9	0	Device is light weight, quiet during operation and produces little to no heat.
180	9	0	I AM IMPRESSED WITH THIS COMPUTER, INEXPENSIVE BUT QUALITY.
181	9	0	The cover is a soft rubber texture without the friction.
182	9	0	It is quiet runs smoothly.
183	9	1	it stopped working 31 days after purchase.
184	9	1	CRASHED only 2 days from getting it!!!!
185	9	1	The plastic materials are rather cheap.
186	9	0	The build is perfect, the screen fantastic, but I do have a bit of a problem with the fact that I have to buy adaptors for nearly everything, from vga cables to ethernet cables, so, almost perfect...
187	9	1	Machine gets fairly hot near the bottom of the screen.
188	9	1	Biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased.
189	9	1	This clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered.
190	9	1	The second one, after a little over a month, refused to turn on even with a full charge.
191	9	1	What a lemon!!
192	9	1	I've had it for a minth and so far it's shut down completely 3 times.

195	9	0	I was surprised  at  the overall quality and the price
196	9	1	This laptop broke within the first hour of use.
197	9	1	Also, after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises.
198	9	1	I'm sure I just got a bad egg, but instead of getting a replacement I decided to try a different one.
199	9	0	It doesn't get heated up much even after continuous usage.
200	9	0	So far I haven't lost any quality or information.
201	9	0	But other than that, I really am loving the quality and speed.

204	9	0	Looks good , well built, and very good speed.
205	9	0	The screen is good, the whole things is very light and doesn't run hot.
206	9	1	It came with no instruction book - no back up CD's and has already crashed.
207	9	0	Retina screen, solid build quality, weight, fast processor and the reliability of the Apple brand.
208	9	1	Now the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic (medium low grade) plastic.
209	9	1	So if you don't have kids, or not in high school or don't accidently sit on it, it should be fine.
210	9	1	used 6 times black screen returned for refund
211	9	0	I would recommend it, for anybody needing a reliable simple laptop.

216	9	1	My Apple mac book pro has crashed three times, since I purchased it.
217	9	1	I believe this MacBook Pro was a lemon right out the gate.
218	9	0	It runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems!
219	9	0	We don't have to de-frag, deliete cookies, run security programs, or any of the common PC problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed.
220	9	0	You can't get a virus on Mac, so in the long run the cost of the Mac is saved by not buying security, and not having to replace your computer every year or two.
221	9	0	- This laptop is so silent, its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load, thanks to the 5th generation Intel core which draws less power,  thus less heat.
222	9	1	The first one arrived and it did not work.
223	9	0	It's portable, reliable, and great for what I use it for.
224	9	0	It's very sturdy.
225	9	0	It looks and feels solid, with a flawless finish.
226	9	0	I've been spoiled by the build quality and stability of Macintosh and even this used computer is a gem.
227	9	0	It churns out HD content, runs without many flaws and I've yet to get a virus on a Mac since I started using the platform in the early 1990's.
228	9	1	Sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while I get my money back for a DEFECTIVE product.
229	9	1	Make sure to only handle this computer with clean hands because the front cover can get oily pretty fast.
230	9	0	Macs hardly ever get viruses, and they are completely incompatible with existing Microsoft Windows Viruses.

232	9	1	He received it, and one day later it DIES.
233	9	1	Of course, it DIES 3 days past the return window.
234	9	1	We got two days of operation from this laptop.
235	9	1	First, when I move the screen to put it in tablet position, the hinge doesn't seem totally solid.
236	9	0	Three years ago I had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great!
237	9	0	3. No anti spyware needed, never had a virus and I never will
238	9	0	4. build solid and durable
239	9	0	This laptop will last you a half decade if not a full decade.
240	9	0	Soon I will be hitting the 5 year mark and I think this thing can make it another 5 in my opinion.
241	9	0	If you are looking for a light, durable, and extremely effecient laptop, buy this one!
242	9	0	Its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great, aside from its quality design and sexy looks.
243	9	0	Also, the laptop is quite, no more burnt laps, best screen display, and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over.
244	9	0	Only thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality!

246	9	0	It feels very well built.
247	9	0	The metal is very expensive feeling.
248	9	1	I received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after I purchased this horrible machine.
249	9	1	They have now basically replaced everything inside my machine, told me there was a problem with the hardware, so I now have a &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; machine.
250	9	1	I had delusions of grandeur regarding Apple's &amp;#34;great customer service&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;reliability of their machines&amp;#34; etc.. etc...blah...blah...
251	9	0	I am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the MAC!
252	9	0	This Mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair.
253	9	0	TLDR version: good, reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive.
254	9	1	This machine has made me go there 5 times and has been nothing but a continuous problem.
255	9	1	(It's a lemon).
256	9	1	Now that they are not virus free ([...]l) I see absolutely no benefit to Apple products as they are slower, more expensive, and do not last as long.
257	9	0	I've had it for more than a year, and I've found that no anti-virus software is needed, as long as you don't download anything without being 100% sure that it's from a legitimate source.
258	9	1	THIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT.
259	9	1	When I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school, I had a hard time from beginning.
260	9	1	At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again.
