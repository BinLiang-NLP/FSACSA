The 13" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.	positive
This is definitely a computer worth the money;	positive
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.	positive
I bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio.	positive
I really like the Mac 15.4in. Notebook, but its very pricey.	negative
But, like I said before, the only reason I don't currently have a Mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey.	negative
The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop.	positive
I'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops, but this fits my budget and the features I need.	positive
It is well worth the money it cost, Very good investment.	positive
Overall though, for the money spent it's a great deal.	positive
I wiped nearly everything off of it, installed OpenOffice and Firefox, and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price.	positive
Good price.	positive
Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.	positive

I spent 2200 dollars on a "top of the line laptop".	negative
1) Payed $2200 for a "premium" laptop	negative
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus.	negative
I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.	negative
My laptop cost approximately $2,300 and DIED after only 2-years, 10-months and 18-days of use.	negative
Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.	positive
Mine came at $1,700 w/o a DVD burner (!).	negative
The only pro to this computer is it was under $600!	positive
I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar.	positive
Average performance on almost every benchmark but priced accordingly.	positive
awesome price for a laptop that lasts more than 8 hours without recharging!	positive
It's not what you pay for.	negative

IT IS VERY LIGHT AND THE PICTURE IS NICE  AND THE PRICE WAS AMAZING.	positive
It wont wow you with its speed but who can complain at $249.	positive
Does what I need it to do and the price was right!	positive
Overall, a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer.	positive
Excellent performance, especially given its price point.	positive
I appreciate the effort to hit affordable pricing Dell but just not worth it.	positive
For $250, I highly recommend!!	positive
GREAT value laptop!	positive
I can't believe this was just $250	positive
All in all, it's well worth its price tag.	positive
D) was under $300 with shipping.	positive
A good value on a quality product.	positive
I needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine.	positive
I AM IMPRESSED WITH THIS COMPUTER, INEXPENSIVE BUT QUALITY.	positive
It is exactly what I expected, and the price is excellent!	positive
You are getting what you pay for and in my opinion, it is worth more.	positive
7.Expensive.	negative
Paid close to $2800 out the door.	negative
For $250, which is as much as my graphics card alone cost, this laptop is an incredible value.	positive
Very good price.	positive
I was surprised  at  the overall quality and the price	positive
If they can fix this, I think it would be a very nice, cost-effective laptop.	positive
Expensive but worth it.	negative
I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, if you want to spend $400+ on a laptop, don't buy this one!	negative
It's definitely not worth the money.	negative
Price makes this the laptop I was looking for.	positive

Love the price too!	positive
Everything at a very great price.	positive
Excellent value and a must buy for someone looking for a Macbook.	positive
You can't get any better than this price and it come with an internal disk drive.	positive
Got this on black friday with a very good discount and couldn't be happier.	positive
And with this price, I don't think you can buy anything better.	positive
It seemed like a great computer and a great deal.	negative
Even though MacBooks are expensive, you will see that they are well worth the money.	negative
While the price may seem high, it is worth every penny with its many perks.	negative
-  With that being said, for the price ($800!), you get a nice fast laptop, but if you ask me, it's missing some things that I feel should be automatically included:	positive
It's a steal when considering the specs and performance as well.	positive
By the way...I paid for this particular laptop roughly 2 grand...LOOK AT THE PRICE NOW!	positive
Only thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality!	negative
It is the cheapest product in the line of MacBook's	positive
Battery doesn't hold up to what it said in the description but I got it refurb'd and I imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price (Just a guess).	positive
I would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy.	negative
Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag, and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs.	negative
This, added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money, detracts from the computer's value.	negative
Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer.	negative
You get what you pay for, right?	negative
Now that they are not virus free ([...]l) I see absolutely no benefit to Apple products as they are slower, more expensive, and do not last as long.	negative
I gave this product 5 stars because I have been looking for a MacBook Pro for a long time and I found it here for a wonderful price.	positive
If the price doesn't deter you, you'll find it well worth it in terms of trouble-free operation.	negative
