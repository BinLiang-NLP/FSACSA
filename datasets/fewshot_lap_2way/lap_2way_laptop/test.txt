332	5	0	Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.
333	5	1	This laptop leaves alot to be desired, I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice...
334	5	1	If you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal.
335	5	1	I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from!
336	5	0	The perfect notebook...
337	5	1	I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE.
338	5	0	I do everything on this computer - check email, facebook, shop, check blogs, write papers, listen to music, and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv.
339	5	0	So, if you're thinking of a laptop, I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook for all your needs!
340	5	0	It's great and we will always stick with Apple computers, we have been so happy with them.
341	5	1	Probbly the worst decision we ever made!
342	5	0	pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.
343	5	1	So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
344	5	1	I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would.
345	5	1	I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use.
346	5	1	It's a bummer and one out of five is being kind.
347	5	1	My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary.
348	5	1	In due course, I'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.

357	5	0	Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop!
358	5	0	Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac!

360	5	1	I don't like this company nor the toshiba brand, and I'll never  buy another one because I've put more into it then it is worth.
361	5	1	I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund.
362	5	1	i cant believe HP put this out.
363	5	1	do not buy you will be disappointed.
364	5	1	i'm returning mine
365	5	1	so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.
366	5	0	I love HP,, it's the only computer/printer we will buy.
367	5	0	At first when I got this product, I loved it.
368	5	0	The computer itself was fast, ran smoothly, and had no problems.
369	5	1	Not worth it one bit.

371	5	1	Don't buy this model.
372	5	1	An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will.
373	5	1	Did I mention everything about it, from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK?
374	5	0	I'm glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC.

389	5	0	I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar.
390	5	0	With all the goodies inside this machine, it is a value.
391	5	1	The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable.
392	5	1	I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card, but still requires a return.

401	5	1	I was so happy with my new Mac.
