64	4	0	Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.
65	4	0	It even has a great webcam, and Skype works very well.
66	4	1	the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer, left right and front.

90	4	1	I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased.

92	4	0	It is sleek, smooth, and lightweight.
93	4	1	The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.

102	4	0	The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.
103	4	0	I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.
104	4	0	However, I love this particular Mac because its very fast, great size, and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad.
105	4	1	The only bad part is the size/weight.
106	4	1	It's like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it's GREAT!

115	4	0	It pretty much does everything we could ever need, and looks great to boot.
116	4	0	Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things, they always come up with good looking products.
117	4	0	i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
118	4	1	First, it does not have a push button to open the lid.
119	4	1	Once open, the leading edge is razor sharp.
120	4	1	This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design.
121	4	0	I like this machine because its very lightweight...
122	4	1	tons of bloatware and junk programs.
123	4	1	keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.
124	4	0	Of course, I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie.
125	4	1	the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.
126	4	1	with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.
127	4	1	The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.
128	4	0	Strengths:Well-shaped
129	4	1	Mine came at $1,700 w/o a DVD burner (!).
130	4	0	The 4 USB ports are nice, but the two on the side only work now and then.

139	4	0	Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere, but still has a big enough screen to get everything done.

142	4	0	Great PC, light and powerful.
143	4	0	Super light weight (I never cared either way about weight until now).

145	4	0	I like the design rather sleek and light.
146	4	1	In the description it said there is Bluetooth but no there isn't.
147	4	1	It dosn't even have a disc compartment
148	4	1	No ethernet outlet
149	4	0	It's easy to operate and it's very light (my parents are almost 60 yo, they can't carry a heavy computer while traveling).
150	4	1	But here's something I hadn't realized before buying it: there isn't an optical drive, which means NO CDs or DVDs!
151	4	1	My mistake was to not research this one, no DVD and no place to insert my ad card to download pictures.
152	4	0	i'm very happy,this laptop is beatifull, is'nt slow at all.
153	4	1	but it doesn't have a cd unit, anyway the other thing is that the laptop does not have an ethernet port for cable connecting.
154	4	0	It is a thing of beauty and fast enough.
155	4	0	IT IS VERY LIGHT AND THE PICTURE IS NICE  AND THE PRICE WAS AMAZING.
156	4	0	NO junkware!!
157	4	0	Very light and beautiful.

159	4	0	Perfect size for me.
160	4	0	It's light and easy to use, though.
161	4	0	The resolution is gorgeous, the computer is light, it does everything I need and the interface is pretty intuitive.
162	4	1	However I am very upset that it doesn't have the superdrive built in!
163	4	1	Con: Hate that it has no disk drive.
164	4	0	Wonderful, super fast, lightweight computer
165	4	0	Bigger screen than expected, laptop with a desktop design that is really nice to use for all types of usage, including programming/editing

169	4	0	Size is perfect and display is beautiful!
170	4	1	This laptop does NOT have an RJ-45 Ethernet adapter for wired network connection.

172	4	0	its very fast and very light.
173	4	1	i am giviing it four stars instead of five because of no disk drive and the crashing
174	4	0	B) a DVD/CD player.
175	4	1	It has some bloat wear that I wish weren't there.
176	4	1	kinda to light and plastic feeling.
177	4	0	Look and feel is good.
178	4	0	Bootup time is amazing, battery life is decent and it has a great slim form factor.
179	4	1	Its also worth noting that there no bluetooth, no mircophone jack, no ethernet, no dvd/cd drive/burner, and no usb 3.0 ports.
180	4	1	The only major negative to me is Windows 8.1 (though YMMV) and the Dell crapware installed.
181	4	0	I needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine.
182	4	0	My favorite colors black and red, the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard.
183	4	0	The laptop is beautiful, not extremely light but thin enough and wide screen with a full keyboard.
184	4	0	Great laptop light and very versatile
185	4	1	Only downfall is the preloaded McAfee and other software.
186	4	0	Device is light weight, quiet during operation and produces little to no heat.
187	4	1	Just wish there were more USB ports.
188	4	0	LOVE THE SIZE, I AM USING THIS FOR WORK, I AM A NURSE AND HAVE TO CHART DAILY, THIS IS EASY TO USE AND I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT.
189	4	0	It's extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive (who uses those anymore anyways) so it easily fits into any college students bag.
190	4	1	I thought it would have a CD-rom drive, but there isnt one.
191	4	1	Also wish it had a port to plug an internet cord into it because sometimes my wifi router likes to not work.
192	4	0	Slick design and looks great.
193	4	0	Glad it has the DVD drive.
194	4	1	My only concern is that since the battery is not external, I will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time.
195	4	1	And the only microphone input is for a combo Mike/Speaker plug.
196	4	0	One really nice thing about Lenovo laptops is that they are not cluttered with a bunch or trial software.
197	4	0	The desktop was clean once I got it up and running.
198	4	0	I really like the video option on it, I stream movies on Amazon Prime and Netflix and there is no lag.
199	4	0	The PC is works well with a good battery and a power cable, and has a web cam.
200	4	1	However, it does not have a DVD drive, neither does it afford one the opportunity to connect an external DVD drive as the manufacturer did not make any point ofconnection of an external drive.
201	4	0	Even my extremely tech savvy boyfriend was impressed with the features and sleek design.
202	4	1	6.Still feels too heavy to me.
203	4	1	Could lose another pound or two.
204	4	0	So with this new order, all the upgrades and windows 8 really caught my eye and I got this for the long haul.
205	4	1	It seems like Lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on.
206	4	1	The cords always feel like they are in my way.
207	4	1	It's clunky, heavy, and a pain to start up and shut down.
208	4	0	Uhhhhhh, the computer looks good.
209	4	0	Looks good , well built, and very good speed.
210	4	0	It has everything I wanted-- built in Wi-Fi connectibility, a slot for my SD camera memory card, a DVD burner, big beautiful screen, plenty of USB ports (three 3.0 and one 2.0), and a keyboard with a nice touch.
211	4	0	I liked the fact that it came with Windows 7, but also included Windows 8 to install later if I need it.
212	4	0	The screen is good, the whole things is very light and doesn't run hot.
213	4	1	Firstly, it has no leds to let you know what is going on, no cap lock, no hard drive indicator, nothing.
214	4	1	Ok, one light to let you know if the damn thing is on.
215	4	0	Retina screen, solid build quality, weight, fast processor and the reliability of the Apple brand.
216	4	0	The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus.
217	4	0	After doing much research for a laptop that had all the features I was looking for, This one hit all the criteria I had.
218	4	0	I bought this for my daughter to use for school and homework, it's not a "fast" computer, but it's great for what she needs it for and very light weight!
219	4	0	Really light you can carry with you everywhere.
220	4	0	You can't get any better than this price and it come with an internal disk drive.
221	4	0	I also really like the addition of the SD Card slot.
222	4	0	If you are afraid of it not having a disc player please don't be.
223	4	0	I love the new high retina display, and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter.
224	4	0	Overall, this is a fast, light, practical computer and I highly recommend it.
225	4	1	And he said&quot; this computer does not have a disk drive and I was furious!
226	4	1	So beware buyer, this computer has a useless piece of plastic on it.
227	4	0	This is larger laptop, but is not too heavy.
228	4	0	However, a few things are immediately occurring to me  I had read the other reviews here on amazon, but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead.
229	4	0	It certainly looks nice, but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out.
230	4	1	It's heavy.
231	4	0	It contains a long battery life, incredible specs, and an overall enjoyable performance.
232	4	0	love the flip feature and the touch screen feature.
233	4	1	this lap top is not the lightest you can purchase, so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more.
234	4	0	You will probably never use it in tablet mode but it's nice to know you have that option.
235	4	0	Lastly, because it can flip 360 you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard.
236	4	0	This MBP is clean, neat, and simple.
237	4	1	Only 2 USB ports.
238	4	1	No HDMI port.
239	4	0	It also has an extra bay for an extra HDD if you wish to add one.

245	4	0	It looks and feels solid, with a flawless finish.
246	4	0	This machine is flawless, fast, and classy.
247	4	0	2-in-1 Capability- The ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus.
248	4	1	The Cons:  No Disc Drive- Call me old fashioned, but I still enjoy listening to physical CDs and uploading them to iTunes.
249	4	1	However, I can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive.
250	4	0	The touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes.
251	4	0	It's also incredibly light, has a battery that can last for days, and looks like a piece of art.
252	4	0	Though, that's pretty much what your paying for -- a well designed device.
253	4	1	When you look at the internal specs, the computer is only worth about $500.
254	4	0	It mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don't need.
255	4	0	Pros :  1. Nice Looks.
256	4	0	5. And this has a extra slot for HDD
257	4	0	6. No CD drive.
258	4	0	This ASUS you're looking at right here, and that I'm typing on right now, has one.
259	4	1	-  With that being said, for the price ($800!), you get a nice fast laptop, but if you ask me, it's missing some things that I feel should be automatically included:
260	4	1	This laptop has no:  - Touchscreen  - Optical Drives (OK, a bit of a stretch, because that would eat up precious space in this monster)  - Swivel or detachable screen
261	4	1	What this laptop does have is:  - Windows 8, which is confusing as all get-out  - Tons of &amp;#34;bloatware&amp;#34;.
262	4	0	Love the 360 degree rotation and the touch screen works great, but a little bit of a learning curve there too, as sometimes I have to tap a few times to get the exact location I need...
263	4	0	I've only had this for a week Overall I like the computer, it's thin &amp; light and The wireless keyboard works great.
264	4	0	I was impressed; Sony puts in small touches like a USB charging port on the charger.
265	4	1	One thing I did't like is the stylus holder, it's cheap plastic and doesn't seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the USB port.
266	4	0	It's light, fast and has great battery!!
267	4	0	It's a steal when considering the specs and performance as well.
268	4	0	The unique to apple aluminium uni-body is a real beauty.
269	4	0	By the way, it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what I had just listed.
270	4	0	If you are looking for a light, durable, and extremely effecient laptop, buy this one!
271	4	0	Like it was designed for what people would want to the system to do, very user-friendly.
272	4	0	Its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great, aside from its quality design and sexy looks.
273	4	0	Also, the laptop is quite, no more burnt laps, best screen display, and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over.
274	4	0	The new operating system called Snow Leopard is installed and ready for use
275	4	0	Reliability: Throughout the past few years, I have had no problems with the MacBook Pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws.
276	4	0	The processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly.
277	4	0	My first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also, brilliant.
278	4	0	Plenty of ports and since this is my first laptop, I really don't have anything to compare it to.
279	4	1	Note: no DVD drive, no Ethernet port
280	4	1	Power on - good luck finding it.
281	4	0	One OS for this platform, no OEM OS paraphernalia and automatic updates.
282	4	0	What it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side, Apple's OSX Mountain Lion, the sleek looks Apple always delivers, reasonable specs, good battery life, nice keyboard, and excellent trackpad.
283	4	1	The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution.
284	4	1	I don't understand why only Windows 7 Starter is included.
285	4	1	I was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain Flash.
