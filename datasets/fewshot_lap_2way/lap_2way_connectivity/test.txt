19	3	1	Its not just slow on the internet, its slow in general.
20	3	0	Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it's a snap.
21	3	0	The internet speed is spectacular.
22	3	0	I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.
23	3	1	in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
24	3	1	Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.
25	3	1	The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.
26	3	1	Needless to say a PC that can't support a cell phone is less than useless!
27	3	1	I can't even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print.
28	3	1	Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.
29	3	1	After purchasing this thing, I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.
30	3	1	But as time went on I found it almost impossible to keep the thing on-line through wi-fi.

41	3	1	Also wish it had a port to plug an internet cord into it because sometimes my wifi router likes to not work.
42	3	1	Wifi card not working right out of the box.
43	3	1	However, it does not have a DVD drive, neither does it afford one the opportunity to connect an external DVD drive as the manufacturer did not make any point ofconnection of an external drive.
44	3	1	The build is perfect, the screen fantastic, but I do have a bit of a problem with the fact that I have to buy adaptors for nearly everything, from vga cables to ethernet cables, so, almost perfect...
45	3	1	I barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load.
46	3	0	It has everything I wanted-- built in Wi-Fi connectibility, a slot for my SD camera memory card, a DVD burner, big beautiful screen, plenty of USB ports (three 3.0 and one 2.0), and a keyboard with a nice touch.
47	3	0	I plugged it into my existing printers and it just worked, no fuss no muss.
48	3	0	It immediately recognized the printer and was ready to go.
49	3	1	The biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it, even when the strength bar is filled.
50	3	1	Also, when you try to download a large file, like a video, it will start out normally, downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec, making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless.
51	3	1	Too often I would find it not being able to stay connected to the internet.
52	3	0	Never had any issues, no frustrations just great easy wireless, all in one fun!

63	3	1	My HP seemed great at first, then the problems started.....wireless adapter would just &quot;disappear&quot; and the system said it didn't have a network card.
64	3	1	Sometimes it comes back, sometimes not.
65	3	1	I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn't go onto our wireless network and I wouldn't have the same problems because it was updated.
