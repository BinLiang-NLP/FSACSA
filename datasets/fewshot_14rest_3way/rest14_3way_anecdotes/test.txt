0	1	1	To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.
1	1	0	For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.
2	1	0	I would definitely recommend Mary's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts.

15	1	0	You'll adore it.
16	1	1	I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.

55	1	0	What more can you ask for?
56	1	2	Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment.

62	1	0	This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.
63	1	0	I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye.
64	1	1	This should have been done in a back room - away from customers.
65	1	0	Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique-seeming teapot, for one) in the restaurant experience.
66	1	2	Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers.
67	1	0	Check it out
68	1	1	Don't go.

78	1	0	We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.
79	1	0	Enjoy!
80	1	2	We weren't!
81	1	0	This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed.
82	1	2	(La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico).

84	1	2	Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!
85	1	2	I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion.
86	1	2	So I've never actually been to M proper, but I've had it delivered a few times.

96	1	1	Don't look down your nose at me like that...
97	1	0	Planet Thai is great!
98	1	1	Just don't do it.
99	1	1	Just ignore the trendy wannabes.

101	1	0	I wish they had one near my office- I would go everyday.
102	1	0	Finally!
103	1	2	I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food, but my friend who took me there is.
104	1	0	You will not be disapointed at all.
105	1	1	Walk-ins are risky too.
106	1	0	I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
107	1	0	Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
108	1	0	Get your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings.
109	1	1	We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it.
110	1	1	Something about them being busy with holiday party's.
111	1	0	I would highly recommend.
112	1	0	This place is great.
113	1	0	With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find!
114	1	1	This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.
115	1	1	Went there last night for 2 year anniversery, and wasn't all that impressed.
116	1	2	At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC.
117	1	0	Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded.
118	1	2	We visit at least once a month.
119	1	2	I'll keep this short.
120	1	2	Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.
121	1	1	However, it's not worth a special trip.
122	1	0	Gigino's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable.
123	1	0	This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.
124	1	1	If that's a problem, go to McDonald's and destroy your insides.
125	1	0	I've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city.
126	1	0	Sexy.
127	1	0	I will have to say, this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite.
128	1	0	overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine), a solid deal as well.
129	1	0	Even with John's and Joe's around the corner, this place will make a name for itself.
130	1	2	My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.
131	1	2	despite the untasteful previous review...
132	1	0	Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.
133	1	2	Sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know Sal, is to know New York.
134	1	0	I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.
135	1	2	My friends spoke so much about it for months, I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.
136	1	2	I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.
137	1	2	This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.
138	1	1	You order from a menu, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience.
139	1	0	One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown.
140	1	0	We will go back every time we are in the City.
141	1	0	we love th pink pony.
142	1	2	So eat fast and order a lot.
143	1	2	I have to agree with the previous reviewer.
144	1	2	--Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons

218	1	2	After reading the good reviews of this restaurant, I decided to give it a try with two friends.
219	1	1	While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.

475	1	0	My roommate and I LOVE this place.
476	1	1	Not worth it.
477	1	2	In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.
478	1	2	This was on a Tuesday night.
479	1	1	Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (I happen to live in Inwood).
480	1	1	Don't waste your time, or money!!
481	1	1	They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.

497	1	0	We will come back!!!

500	1	2	But on a lazy Saturday night, we ended up going.
501	1	2	I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.
502	1	2	Once for dinner and once for brunch.
503	1	0	I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.

505	1	2	I only have friends.
506	1	1	Please save yourself the frustration.
507	1	2	I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.
508	1	2	We were on our way back to NJ, and since I am in NY, we figured why not grab some food?
509	1	2	And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair.
510	1	0	I was pleasantly suprised.
511	1	2	One less manhattanite the better.
512	1	2	Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.

541	1	2	After the review I treked into Brooklyn.
542	1	1	When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check.

545	1	0	Yeah, it's that good.

548	1	0	I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.
549	1	0	I have been going back again and again.
550	1	0	Overall, excellent restaurant!
551	1	1	When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
552	1	0	I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it!

559	1	1	now if they could only get a toaster.
560	1	0	You will find yourself returning quite often.
561	1	1	Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place.
562	1	2	Having discovered Ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in.

564	1	1	It appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows.

604	1	0	Everytime my husband and I go there, we are never disappointed.
605	1	0	We were not disappointed.
606	1	2	I've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food.
607	1	1	We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but, that's just it -- the PAST!
608	1	2	Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.
609	1	2	When we left at 8:00 PM, it was packed and noisy.

631	1	0	Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!
632	1	2	Similar to other Indian restaurants, they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door.
633	1	2	The people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at.

667	1	1	This place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else.
668	1	2	Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants.
669	1	0	Big thumbs up!
670	1	2	we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda.
671	1	2	We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant.
672	1	2	That's why you have to pay more for that.
673	1	2	If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
674	1	0	I loved it.
675	1	2	They're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing, Queens.
676	1	2	but I wouldn't wanna live there.
677	1	2	Arigato Gozimas Yuka!
678	1	0	Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn.

691	1	2	My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I couldn't believe the food.
692	1	0	I take all my NYC guests to VT's.
693	1	1	Even with the prix fixe pricing, this restaurant is not worth it.
694	1	0	Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off, like in this case.
695	1	0	However, their popularity has yet to slow down, and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation.
696	1	2	The place wasn't too hard to find, but it was kind of packed, as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food, the line reached the door.
697	1	0	I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites.
698	1	2	A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks.
699	1	2	I went to DF for Valentines Day dinner.
700	1	0	I LOVED THE SHOWS.
701	1	2	and i have been around the block, to say the very least.
702	1	0	My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food.
703	1	2	As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats ,except at Taj Mahal.
704	1	0	Give it a try and enjoy.
705	1	2	...and that's saying a lot.
706	1	1	The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.

708	1	0	Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!
709	1	0	I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city.
710	1	0	for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location!
711	1	0	Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends.
712	1	0	I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed.
713	1	2	Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity.
714	1	0	I have had so many dinners here and it's always been perfect - on a date with my husband, with my mom, with girlfriends and larger groups.
715	1	1	I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this, but the second visit was even worse.
716	1	2	Also, if you don't want to sit at a certain table, you don't have to!
717	1	0	Unbelievable.
718	1	0	A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!
719	1	2	I've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens.
720	1	0	As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling.
721	1	0	The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.
722	1	0	My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.
723	1	1	This restaurant was way overhyped.
724	1	1	I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.
725	1	0	Now at the top of our list, Del Frisco's Steakhouse.
726	1	0	I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.
727	1	1	This was the worst dining experience I've ever had.
728	1	0	I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
729	1	2	Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again, I will certainly stop by.
730	1	1	Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair.
731	1	0	I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough.
732	1	0	In fact, you can't miss it.
733	1	0	I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great.
734	1	2	It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown.
735	1	2	Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.
736	1	1	I don't get it, what's so special about Prune ?
737	1	0	I'd definitely recommend this little place.
738	1	0	Again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.
739	1	0	Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe's to eat here.
740	1	0	I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more!
741	1	1	Get it together.
742	1	0	The eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce.
743	1	0	In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch, this place is great.
744	1	1	In fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and I couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible.
745	1	1	If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.
746	1	0	A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town.
747	1	0	I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!
748	1	1	The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in Chinese.
749	1	0	Enjoy!!!
750	1	0	Kudos to Po!
751	1	2	My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended.

753	1	1	Never again!
754	1	1	For Park avenue I expected so much more.
755	1	1	So rude.
756	1	1	There are much better places in NY with better prices.
757	1	0	Everything is delicious, though, my gf and I come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted!
758	1	0	Still, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best dining experiences.
759	1	0	Overall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.
760	1	2	We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore.
761	1	0	I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.
762	1	0	I plan on stopping by next week as well.

764	1	0	We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food.
765	1	0	Highly recommended to all!
766	1	0	highly recommended.
767	1	1	Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place, and are not in a rush, this place is a bad idea.
768	1	0	It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC.
769	1	0	I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.
770	1	1	If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I'd go out in Manhattan.
771	1	2	After a seafood craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info.
772	1	0	This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!
773	1	0	This is a fun restaurant to go to.
774	1	2	Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night.
775	1	0	Bravissimo !!
776	1	0	Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch!
777	1	0	We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience!!!
778	1	0	Found service above average, but that could be because we were 13 of us.
779	1	0	When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back, in a veyr good sense.
780	1	2	This is the Cheers of New York, whether you've ever been there or not.
781	1	0	It's to die for!
782	1	1	Overall a disappointing experience for that price category.
783	1	2	I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.
784	1	0	You will be satisfied.
785	1	0	Another great place to take out-of-towners!
786	1	2	But, hey, there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in Astoria.
787	1	1	We were less than impressed.
788	1	1	A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?
789	1	1	but still my date was bad
790	1	0	Would definitely go back again.
791	1	0	I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.

798	1	0	Go for it!
799	1	0	Highly recommended.
800	1	0	You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.
801	1	2	I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.
802	1	2	To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.
803	1	0	I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.
804	1	2	We always get a sampling of appetizers and share.
805	1	0	Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to Price Ratio).
806	1	0	Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.
807	1	2	No food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food.
808	1	0	Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
809	1	1	Not a great place for family or general dining.
810	1	2	I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.
811	1	2	Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
812	1	1	I was wrong.
813	1	1	No plans to return anytime soon.
814	1	0	I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine.
815	1	1	I just do not understand what the fuss is all about.
816	1	0	We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.
817	1	2	I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.
818	1	1	For an untrendy rip-off- eat here.
819	1	0	I can't wait to go back.
820	1	1	I HATE HATE HATE this place.

827	1	0	So all I'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I've ever been to.
828	1	1	We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food.
829	1	1	The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!
830	1	1	wont come back again for sure!
831	1	2	i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.
832	1	1	After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table.
833	1	0	Bon appettite!!
834	1	0	La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.
835	1	0	A great addition to Smith Street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots.
836	1	1	We spent $200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed.
837	1	0	It is simply amazing.
838	1	2	I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted.
839	1	1	I liked this place the first time but doubt I will ever return.
840	1	2	A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $2.50.
841	1	1	Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
842	1	0	This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced.
843	1	0	Bravo, Blue Hill!
844	1	0	Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.
845	1	2	My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village.
846	1	1	This place is to be avoided.
847	1	1	My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who don't know what they are doing.
848	1	2	At 6:30, we were the third party there.
849	1	0	I will definetly be going back.
850	1	2	No, really.
851	1	2	I've been to Naples 45 for dinner twice.
852	1	0	I'm saving up for my next visit.
853	1	1	Amma is nothing special.
854	1	2	Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out.
855	1	2	believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.
856	1	0	Worth it for a special occasion, or any time!
857	1	0	I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady.
858	1	2	I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike, a great name for a joint if ever I saw one.
859	1	2	Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.
860	1	0	Definitely a once a year treat that I look forward to around the holidays!
861	1	2	from an English speaking staff.
862	1	0	A defitely must visit.
863	1	2	I went here with a friend on a whim, we went someplace else first and couldn't get a table.

869	1	1	Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude.
870	1	2	My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar (chef Yoshi) and ordered everything ala carte.
871	1	2	A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30.
872	1	0	20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other.

877	1	0	I definitely will go back.
878	1	2	Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.
879	1	0	I've never been disappointed.
880	1	2	From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.
881	1	0	My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed.
882	1	0	I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons.
883	1	0	For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, I don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.
884	1	2	But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out.
885	1	2	I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.
886	1	0	Beautiful experience.

888	1	2	Jimmy is Dominican!
889	1	2	Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)
890	1	0	When my husband and go there, we spend $60.00 (have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more) I can't say any more, it a place you'll never forget If you never go, you'll miss A Meal of your life time
891	1	1	The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead.
892	1	0	If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.
893	1	2	This is also where I was from.
894	1	2	Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.

904	1	0	THE FRANKENSTEIN SHOW WAS THE BEST.
905	1	1	As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst.

976	1	0	But trust me it is so worth it.
977	1	2	It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge.

1034	1	0	I would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again.
1035	1	0	What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot.

1068	1	2	Want to impress?

1082	1	0	How do you rate home?
1083	1	2	I went here in the afternoon with a friend.
1084	1	2	I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies.

1086	1	2	Boy was I wrong!
1087	1	2	We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.
1088	1	2	When we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years.
1089	1	2	Ahhh...
1090	1	1	Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.
1091	1	2	it helps if you know what to order.

1228	1	0	No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town, Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination.

1254	1	2	I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it.

1256	1	0	To the owners; good job guys, this place is a keeper!
1257	1	0	perfect for a quick meal.
