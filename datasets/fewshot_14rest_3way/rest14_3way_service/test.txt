125	2	0	Authentic food and they have REAL service, not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door.

154	2	1	like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan.
155	2	2	However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.

166	2	1	First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...
167	2	0	The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.
168	2	0	When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.

170	2	0	This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.

181	2	1	Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.
182	2	0	If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in NYC.
183	2	0	The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.
184	2	0	The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!
185	2	1	With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.
186	2	1	The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives.
187	2	0	Not only is the cuisine the best around, the service has always been attentive and charming.

195	2	0	Great food, great prices, great service.
196	2	1	Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.
197	2	1	In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.
198	2	0	But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get.
199	2	0	The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.
200	2	0	Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food.
201	2	0	It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence.
202	2	0	We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.

245	2	0	This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.

247	2	1	They brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.
248	2	2	We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off.

284	2	0	Good, fast service.
285	2	1	I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced.
286	2	0	The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly I might add).
287	2	2	The service was ok.
288	2	1	When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
289	2	0	The staff is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world!
290	2	0	The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.
291	2	1	The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.

293	2	0	The staff are attentive, and have smiles on their faces.
294	2	1	Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food, but turns out to be poorly run and awful.
295	2	0	After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.
296	2	0	When he's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms, he's visiting the regulars (a growing legion) and checking on newcomers.
297	2	1	Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!
298	2	0	The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.

301	2	1	There is no excuse for such lousy service!
302	2	0	We were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.
303	2	1	The service is awful--the last time I was there (and I do mean the last time) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave.
304	2	1	Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table (even though we had reservations).
305	2	0	night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience.
306	2	0	We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional.
307	2	0	You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys (masaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it.
308	2	1	Last memorial day, I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend (interesting, but...).
309	2	0	When we sat, we got great and fast service.

326	2	0	The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).
327	2	0	Service was very good and warm.
328	2	1	Like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes, a busy restaurant may require you to wait.
329	2	1	The people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at.
330	2	0	We've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we've been lucky?
331	2	1	The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level.
332	2	0	The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing.
333	2	2	However, service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had.
334	2	1	The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.
335	2	1	The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.
336	2	1	We only ordered desserts and drinks, but no refills were offered.
337	2	0	Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.
338	2	1	They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.
339	2	1	The kitchen however, is almost always slow.
340	2	0	Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.
341	2	0	Also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do...
342	2	1	Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.

344	2	0	I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.

346	2	0	Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.
347	2	0	They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.
348	2	0	Orsay, is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food, and French service as well.
349	2	0	It's easy to get a table for a large group and you don't get hustled out.
350	2	1	Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot.
351	2	1	Yes, there might be a wait if you have no reservations.
352	2	1	Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food.
353	2	0	The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed.
354	2	1	(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.
355	2	0	The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.
356	2	0	Everyone was more then happy with his choices.
357	2	0	Again, the waitress was awesome.
358	2	0	The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
359	2	0	Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining.
360	2	1	As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.
361	2	1	The only disappointment was the coat check girls who didn't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night (for the coat check girls).
362	2	0	We had great desserts (including the best cannoli I've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house.
363	2	1	We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.
364	2	1	The Halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.
365	2	0	The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly.
366	2	0	Always great service!
367	2	1	If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.
368	2	1	The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful.
369	2	1	Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.
370	2	1	Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
371	2	0	Also, if you don't want to sit at a certain table, you don't have to!
372	2	1	The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.
373	2	1	I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.
374	2	0	I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.

376	2	0	We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning.

387	2	0	They are FAST.
388	2	1	I've waited over one hour for food.
389	2	1	Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.
390	2	0	Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine.

393	2	0	Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!
394	2	0	The service was attentive, yet discreet.
395	2	1	Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!
396	2	1	You have to increase the service a lot.
397	2	1	They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.

400	2	0	Service is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens.
401	2	0	The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
402	2	1	Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating.
403	2	0	Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.
404	2	0	A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.
405	2	0	Found service above average, but that could be because we were 13 of us.
406	2	0	(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve.
407	2	0	The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.

415	2	0	We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
416	2	0	The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
417	2	1	You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.
418	2	1	The service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.
419	2	1	It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses.
420	2	0	The service is descent even when this small place is packed.

427	2	0	The staff offers impeccable service.

437	2	1	Bottom line: B+ for the food, F for the service.
438	2	0	The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.
439	2	0	The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view.
440	2	1	We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.

446	2	1	I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.

451	2	0	The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.
452	2	0	Waitstaff is great, very attentive.
453	2	0	We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if I call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so I wouldn't have to look for parking).
454	2	1	And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles' heel.
455	2	0	Nice ambiance, nice little bar, good bartender, Francois, and good service.
456	2	1	We didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.
457	2	0	Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food.
458	2	2	in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse.
459	2	1	Average to good Thai food, but terrible delivery.
460	2	1	The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.
461	2	0	And they provided a delicious dessert on the house!
462	2	1	They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited.
463	2	0	The staff was very attentive, the ambience lovely, and the food superb.
464	2	0	THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.

466	2	0	The service was superb, they treat you like family.

475	2	0	The service is fantastic.
476	2	2	Food and service was okay.
477	2	1	Over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason.
478	2	0	Great pizza and fantastic service.
479	2	1	We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.
480	2	1	I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it.
481	2	1	i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.
482	2	1	They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!
483	2	1	I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.
484	2	1	Staffs are not that friendly, but the taste covers all.
485	2	1	Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.
486	2	0	The waiter was attentive.
487	2	0	Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!
488	2	0	We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!

490	2	1	The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected.
491	2	0	They're also friendlier here, especially the owner, Kenny.
492	2	0	Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
493	2	2	My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered, but some other items that were not ordered.
494	2	0	You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge!
495	2	0	If it isn't for the food (A+++), it must be the service or the ambience.
496	2	1	During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.
497	2	0	The staff makes you feel at home, the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL!

500	2	0	Service- friendly and attentive.
501	2	0	Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.

506	2	1	They never came back to refill our glasses again.

508	2	0	Service was also very good.
509	2	1	They're rude at times, and not very friendly.
510	2	1	The sushi has been from average to below average, the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen, the acousitcs are horrid, everything echoes is extremely loud).
511	2	1	but the service was a bit slow.
512	2	1	No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates.
513	2	0	We had a 3 hour brunch- they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time.
514	2	1	And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service!
515	2	0	The service was excellent, the food was excellent, but the entire experience was very cool.
516	2	0	The service is good and the resturant is clean.
517	2	1	The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the service could have been better.

519	2	0	I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.
520	2	0	Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!
521	2	0	The service was great as well.
522	2	0	From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed.
523	2	0	I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there.

526	2	0	The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start.
527	2	0	I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table.
528	2	0	Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.
529	2	1	The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.
530	2	2	The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you, brother?

536	2	0	The food was great and the service was even better.
537	2	1	We were seated and ignored by waitstaff.
538	2	1	They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt.

540	2	1	they did give a 15% discount at the end, wasn't enough, as they knew the service was horrible.

711	2	1	Good cake BUT: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees.
712	2	1	The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.

721	2	1	The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow.
722	2	1	I asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter.
723	2	0	Sweet Irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face.
724	2	1	Its good to go there for drinks if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad.
725	2	1	Anyway, the owner was fake.
726	2	0	Owner is pleasant and entertaining.
727	2	1	I have never in my life sent back food before, but I simply had to, and the waiter argued with me over this.
